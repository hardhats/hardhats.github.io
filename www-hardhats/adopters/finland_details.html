<H1>DHCP in Finland</H1>
<H2>Fifteen years of Finnish DHCP</H2>
<P>Since the mid-1980s the majority (about two thirds) of the hospital
information systems in Finland have been based on VA FileMan/Kernel, although
the applications packages are locally developed.  There are some half dozen
software companies providing systems support and applications packages to
hospitals.  The Computing Centre of the University of Kuopio obtains new
FileMan/Kernel/MailMan versions from the VA, translates and localizes them,
distributes them to the software houses and teaching hospitals for onward
distribution to smaller hospitals, and provides systems support.  More
description of this <EM>&quot;MUSTI Project&quot;</EM> is      
<A HREF="http://www.uku.fi/laitokset/atk-keskus/english//musti.html">available
on the Web.</A> </P>
<H2>Developing a new &quot;front end&quot;</H2>
<P>In 1995 three teaching hospitals, Mylab Corporation, and the Kuopio
Computing Centre established a project to &quot;modernize&quot; the legacy
systems.  The Managing Director of Mylab (a laboratory system vendor in Finland)
is
<A HREF="mailto:esa@mylab.fi">Esa Soini</A>, who worked on the DoD
<EM>CHCS</EM> project in the US.  The project adopted the VA's RPC Broker
technology and FMComponents at a very early stage, and developed a value-added
layer of high-level components on top of them.  This toolset is called <EM>FixIT</EM>.
 The work has been described in two articles published in <CITE>M Computing</CITE>
and
<A HREF="http://www.uku.fi/laitokset/atk-keskus/tj/fixit/english.html">in a
conference paper for MEDINFO'98</A>   All the half-a-dozen software companies
have ordered FixIT.  Mylab Corp. has developed a prototype application with it,
and University of Kuopio has just launched two applications internally for the
university administration.  However, all the software companies have made a
strategic choice to work on 32-bit Windows platforms only, so for almost a year
now they have been waiting for RPC Broker 1.1, from the DVA, to be able to start
applications development in earnest.</P>
<H2>A Web interface for FileMan?</H2>
<P>  Another new project is  <EM>Web-FixIT</EM>, designed to transform the
Delphi-FixIT toolset to the thin client architecture and Java.  The teaching
hospitals and software houses are funding the project, and Kuopio is currently
negotiating funding from the Technology Development Centre of Finland, a
government research foundation.  The basic idea is described in
<A HREF="http://www.uku.fi/laitokset/atk-keskus/tj/fixit/medinfo.pdf">another
MEDINFO'98 paper (requiring a &quot;pdf&quot; reader like Acrobat).</A></P>
<P> The Finns have already experimented in developing the high-level visual
components in Java using Borland's<EM> JBuilder</EM>.  However, this project is
critically dependent on whether RPC Broker Client 1.1 can be used from Java, or
a Java Bean version of it can be developed.   They report that they would be
very happy to share the results of the FixIT project with the VA, or to develop
the thin-client/Java version to the VA as a subcontractor without financial
implications.</P>
