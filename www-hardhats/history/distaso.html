              <p align="center">DHCP's greatest tragedy occurred on November 26,
            1989, when Michael Distaso, and his partner, Keith
            Orner (of InterSystems Corp.) died at Point Reyes,
            California. Two days later, when the accident was
            discovered, Ingeborg Kuhn, Michael's supervisor, sent
            a message out to the VA's FORUM electronic-mail
            system. The message and its responses remain a
            testimony to the tragedy.</p>

    </center></div><p><strong>INGEBORG KUHN </strong>It is with
    deepest sorrow that we have to let you know that Michael
    Distaso died over the weekend as a result of an accident at
    the Point Reyes National Park. It appears that he was trying
    to help his friend Keith who was in danger on some cliffs at
    the sea shore. We believe that Keith too is lost. We loved
    him dearly, he will be missed. </p>
    <p>Response #1: <strong>GABER,ROY</strong> Sincerest
    condolences to the friends and family. </p>
    <p>Response #2: <strong>WILLIAMS,LARRY</strong> Ingeborg, I
    am at a loss as to what to say... I am sitting here in shock.
    Please express my deepest regrets to everyone there and let
    me (us) know what we can do from here. All of us have
    suffered a great loss.</p>
    <p>Response #3: <strong>HARVEY,JULIE S</strong> Zach was an
    energetic, brillant, original and everyone who met him came
    away with the same impression. I have always held the belief
    that at times like these flowers and testimonials always
    consoled the sender more than the receiver. It would be nice
    to see those energies channeled into something that could
    impact others as much as Zach did us. In the days to follow,
    when heads and eyes are clearer, I would be interested in
    learning of a charity or fund that Zach felt deeply about. I
    think an audience this large could make quite an impact. Some
    things will never be the same. </p>
    <p>Response #4: <strong>CHOU,JULIUS</strong> I don't know
    what to say but some thing will never be the same. I like to
    second Julie's suggestion. His contribution to DHCP will
    never be forgetten.</p>
    <p>Response #5: <strong>LUSHENE,BOB</strong> They say that
    life goes on ... but Michael brought an intellectual honesty,
    a forthrightness, an ability to make peace among warring
    factions that no one else in DHCP is quite able to do. He
    represented an ideal for some of us .. an idealist in a
    political jungle where idealists don't usually fare too well.
    XAK was in the middle of some of the most important things he
    had ever done. Maybe, someway, somehow, we can pay our
    greatest tribute by contining to steer the steady course he
    outlined. </p>
    <p>Response #6: <strong>SOKOL,EUNICE</strong> We who were
    fortunate enough to attend MUG in New Orleans will never
    forget OUR clown, who led the parade down to the wharf. The
    man was most unique. DHCP has lost someone very special! </p>
    <p>Response #7: <strong>DAVIS,JACOB</strong> There are no
    words to express the shock of such a loss. I remember Michael
    as being full of life. Julie's idea would be a wonderful
    tribute to one who contributed so much... </p>
    <p>Response #8: <strong>THOMAS,SKIP</strong> Mere words
    cannot begin to express the depth of our collective loss. </p>
    <p>Response #9: <strong>PIPER,NEIL</strong> I am deeply
    sorrowed by Zack's death. I remember his brilliance, his
    quick wit, his good nature, his smile and his laugh. I was
    extremely impressed by his ability to think quickly and
    rapidly find solutions. He was a man who touched the lives of
    everyone he met. He will be missed. </p>
    <p>Response #10: <strong>KLAVOHN,RON </strong>Words are not
    enough at times like these. Life is always in a constant
    state of change and he will be MISSED. I also like Julie's
    suggestion. If we can be of any help, let us know. </p>
    <p>Response #11: <strong>FOSTER,WILLIAM</strong> No words can
    express the loss.......... </p>
    <p>Response #12: <strong>BAKER,ROY</strong> All of XAK's
    friends here in Dallas are shocked and saddened by this news.
    He will be remembered fondly by all of those who came into
    contact with him. </p>
    <p>Response #13: <strong>DEL SOTA,MICHAEL</strong> XAK was
    such a nice man, he took me under his wing and taught me so
    much. The little time that i spent with him will be
    cheerished forever. A great loss has come to DHCP. I also
    agree with Julie's idea. </p>
    <p>Response #14: <strong>LEAHEY,CHARLES </strong>A great loss
    to all. VA meetings, MUG conferences, and the MDC meetings
    will not be the same without Michael and his special charm
    and insight. I also agree with Julie's idea. </p>
    <p>Response #15: <strong>BATES,MARINA</strong> Words can not
    express the profound sense of loss that the Chicago ISC as
    well as the whole of DHCP is experiencing by this news. May
    in this time of sorrow, all of us remember the leadership and
    joy that Xak brought into our lives. </p>
    <p>Response #16: <strong>CURTIS,CLAYTON</strong> All of IHS
    grieves with Michael's friends in the VA. Those of us who
    were personal, in addition to professional, friends of XAK's
    are saddened beyond words. </p>
    <p>Response #17: <strong>TUCKER,NANCY</strong> The Salt Lake
    ISC sends its condolences and deepest sympathy. We are all
    shocked by the news of this terrible tragedy. Please let us
    know about charitable contributions/flowers or whatever is
    deemed appropriate. We are so terribly sorry. </p>
    <p>Response #18: <strong>ROTH,TERRY</strong> ALAS! THAT
    SPRING SHOULD VANISH WITH THE ROSE-- THAT YOUTH'S SWEET
    SCENTED MANUSCRIPT SHOULD CLOSE. THE NIGHTINGALE THAT IN THE
    BRANCHES SANG, O WHENCE, AND WHITHER FLOWN AGAIN? Ingeborg,
    Hans, Tami, Linda--my heart is with you. </p>
    <p>Response #19: <strong>IVEY,JOEL</strong> Our loss of XAK
    will be felt by all that knew him. He impressed people in a
    lot of different ways, but always on the good side. Zach may
    be gone, but in us still lives within, Death takes not what
    was, only might have been. </p>
    <p>Response #20: <strong>HAUCK,MICHAEL </strong>The words and
    thoughts of Julie, Neil and the rest express my feelings
    better than I am able. Alas, a good friend and one of our
    best is with us no more. </p>
    <p>Response #21: <strong>CUTHBERTSON,TERRY </strong>We too
    are in shock. What a tragedy. Its so hard to lose a good
    friend. Please keep us informed on how we may contribute to
    some special memorial for Zach. </p>
    <p>Response #22: <strong>ANETRELLA,LOUIS J </strong>THE
    NORTHPORT RMEC SENDS ITS DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO ALL HIS
    FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.HE WILL BE MISSED GREATLY. </p>
    <p>Response #23: <strong>ROBINSON,EUGENE</strong> Those of us
    here at William Beaumont Army Medical Center send their
    deepest condolences to his family and friends. Perhaps those
    who are planning the next MUMPS convention, might consider
    dedicating the convention to Mike. </p>
    <p>Response #24: <strong>SORAOKA,DANIEL T </strong>We have
    always received the best and fastest solutions with a bright
    and cheerful attitude which was full of creativity and wit.
    Honolulu expresses our deepest condolences on such a great
    loss. </p>
    <p>Response #25: <strong>TIMSON,GEORGE</strong> Like
    Shakespeare, whom Michael so revered, he taught us through
    Comedy, and now through Tragedy, what life is about. By his
    example, he showed us what our life could be, and what our
    work could accomplish, if we treated each person as someone
    to be interested in, each moment as one to relish, each task
    as one to be performed to the absolute best of our abilities.
    As Bob Lushene said, he was truly an idealist. He stuck by
    his principles, always, especially the principle that
    phonyness and pompousness should be, at every opportunity,
    subverted by honesty and glee. There are some people who
    think that I was Michael's mentor. The truth is that he was
    mine. I will always be grateful for the opportunity of
    knowing him and working with him in the VA. I join with each
    of you in your sorrow, and in your celebration of his memory.
    <cite>&quot;Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet
    Prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!&quot; </cite></p>
    <p>Response #26: <strong>JOHNSON,SYLVESTER</strong> No words
    can express the deepest of regrets for a man who forged the
    streams of deepest dispair to accomplish so great a task as
    Fileman. As I finihed teaching my last class of fileman at
    this site, I marvel at the unique of the package construction
    because I have worked with many database and just as many
    systems. I founded a confidence and a comfortable zone in
    working with the complexity of it's simplicity. My heart
    weeps for the family and friends whom have had personal
    contact with Michael. May his talents not be forgotten but
    remembered with the greatest of easy as we seek out his
    thougt through fileman.</p>
    <p>Response #27: <strong>MOODY,SUSAN</strong> The Dallas ISC
    wishes to contribute toward whatever is decided from Julie's
    suggestion. We are also planning to send a card to his family
    as soon as an address is available. Although I did not know
    him as well as the rest of you, from the many stories of
    co-workers who knew him and the many times I answered the
    phone and it was him calling, he seemed to be a wonderful
    person. He will be missed by everyone whose lives he touched.
    </p>
    <p>Response #28: <strong>SWATZELL,ROY</strong> In the 9 years
    of DHCP many great champions of this cause have come and
    gone, but this loss may be the greatest! We shall all miss
    him greatly. </p>
    <p>Response #29: <strong>AUCHMOODY,RICHARD</strong> If you
    are interested in sending a card to Michael's family, the
    address is: Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vito Distaso 1128 W. Ramona Road
    Alhambra, CA 91803 </p>
    <p>Response #30: <strong>WEISS,LINDA W</strong> My
    condolences to those of you who were Zach's extended family
    in DHCP. As a clinical person, he was always most patient in
    his work with those of us who weren't in the IRM know and
    helped us to develop some outstanding products. I remeber a
    dinner in Boston where Zach and Keith taught my son and I the
    proper way to eat guacamole which was to intersperse
    mouthfuls with famous quotes. It is amost fond memory and we
    were fortunate to have had such a gift from both. I would
    like to participate in any memorial arrangements also. </p>
    <p>Response #31:<strong> SEEGER,ANTHONY</strong> THIS MAIL
    MESSAGE HAS TOUCHED DEEP CORDS WITHIN MY PSYCHE AS WELL. I
    hope that Mike can read this mail message so he can
    understand just how deeply he will be missed here on earth. I
    will remember him every time I DO P^DII, THANKS MIKE FOR THE
    VISION, I WILL LIGHT A CANDLE IN YOUR MEMORY. </p>
    <p>Response #32:<strong> GRAY,JAMES</strong> What a shock.
    Others have said things much better than I could. He will be
    missed dearly. </p>
    <p>Response #33: <strong>LILLY,MAUREEN</strong> The loss of
    Michael has left us with a void both personally and
    professionally. In his role as a newly-elected MUG Board
    member, his enthusiasm in representing MUMPS users had just
    begun. But Michael had been a strong advocate of MUG for many
    years. The MUG Board and staff will always be grateful for
    his steadfast support and will cherish our memories. In an
    effort to perpetuate Michael's love of MUMPS, the MUG Board
    of Directors has decided to establish a memorial fund.
    Specific details will be discussed the our December Board
    meeting. If you have comments on the memorial fund, they will
    be passed on to the Board in time for that meeting. </p>
    <p>Response #34: <strong>HOFFMAN,JOHN</strong> George beat me
    to the quote mentioned above. I offer another quote from the
    bard: <cite>&quot;Tell me where is fancy bred, Or in the
    heart or in the head? How begot, how nourished? Reply, reply
    ...&quot; </cite></p>
    <p>Response #35: <strong>LILLY,MAUREEN</strong> The loss of
    Michael has left us with a void both personally and
    professionally. In his role as a newly-elected MUG Board
    member, his enthusiasm in representing MUMPS users had just

    be passed on to the Board in time for that meeting. </p>
    <p>Response #36: <strong>RICHARDSON,CHRIS </strong>We at US
    Public Health Services, will miss Michael dearly. He will be
    sorely missed. Personally, the MDC will not be the same
    without him. </p>
    <p>Response #37: <strong>SANSOM,TERRY </strong>Although I was
    not personally acquainted with Michael, I feel a deep loss at
    his passing. I probably would not be where I am today, if it
    had not been for his assistance in the early 80's. Each time
    that I teach a FileMan class in the future, there will be a
    feeling of a great loss &amp; extreme reverence for him. My
    condolences to his family &amp; many friends. </p>
    <p>Response #38: <strong>KREIS,GREG </strong>Since the news
    of Michael's death I have been experiencing the short 'clips'
    of special moments with Michael, as many of you also have.
    They seem to come of their own accord and they make the
    burden a little lighter at times. I though I might share a
    few.... I remember laughing on the phone so hard, that we
    both felt compelled to close our office doors to avoid
    disrupting others. I remember the time Michael gave Roy
    Swatzell a load of verbal buckshot, by accident, that was
    meant for me. I remember his frustration at the politics that
    ran counter to what he knew was the right thing. I remember
    that Michael ALWAYS let you know where you stood with him. If
    you knew Michael well, you came to appreciate his rugged
    honesty, even though sometimes it smarted, it was often
    needed. I remember how he somehow fancied the title given to
    him of the 'little dictator'. I remember riding in a car with
    Michael as the driver ! I remember looking over at him as he
    looked in the rear view mirror and knowing that he must have
    pulled out in front fof a Mac truck ! His eyes were as wide
    as saucers. I remember how I could never fill his shoes when
    I was given pharmacy and how he had such an effective way to
    make progress no matter what was going on around him. I
    remember the early pharmacy SIUG meetings and seeing how much
    they appreciated his hard work and dedication. Oh Michael, we
    miss you so much already. I am sad that I have had to shut my
    door for the last time.... </p>
    <p>Response #39: <strong>DEMOEL,ED </strong>It's not just in
    the US that Xak will be missed. The little contact we had
    with him in Europe was cordial and pleasant. Condolences to
    those he left behind. </p>
    <p>Response #40: <strong>WERNERS,MARCUS </strong>I am sitting
    in front of my computer and cant believe it. He was with us
    in January here in Berlin. No words can express what we feel
    now. The &quot;Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag&quot; has
    lost a friend. I personally will never forget the clown. If I
    could do anything to help those who worked with him let me
    know. </p>
    <p>Response #41: <strong>SCHADLE,KATHY</strong> Xak, you may
    be physically gone from our lives but you will never be
    forgotten. The mere touch of a computer key will keep you
    always in our thoughts. IRM staff from Tampa, Fl. </p>
    <p>Response #42: <strong>WRAY,CECELIA </strong>A Stop,
    listen...can you hear Michael laugh? Remember that, because
    it is only one of the most precious gifts he left. The memory
    of his laugh. My sincerest sympathy to all his family and
    friends. </p>
    <p>Response #43: <strong>CLARKE,CHRISTOPHER</strong> May the
    Blessings of God rest upon you May His Peace abide with you
    May His Presence illuminate your heart Now and forever more. </p>
    <p>Response #44:<strong> MEEHAN,DON</strong> I speak for the
    entire IRM staff at Richmond in expressing our deepest
    sympathies. Michael will be remembered for much more than his
    brilliant contributions to what we all do. He touched each of
    personally, and taught us to not take our jobs, our
    organizations, our lives too seriously. Forever more,
    whenever I'm up against it, I'll remember that laugh, that
    clown...and I'll smile. Goodbye Michael, and thank you. </p>
    <p>Response #45: <strong>ROTH,TERRY</strong> I think the most
    effective and lasting memorial to Michael would be: 1.
    Develop an effective Bullshit Detector and USE IT! Call a
    spade a spade. 2. Be tolerant of those who march to a
    different drummer, and let people know exactly where they
    stand with you. 3. Don't engage in whining about the
    system--roll up your sleeves and get the job done. Do the
    best you can: work hard, love hard, and laugh a lot,
    especially when things get grim. </p>
    <p>Response #46: <strong>WAGNER,STEVEN</strong> When Zach
    talked about death he always said &quot;I don't want to die
    old.&quot;. With his youthful exuberance and outlook on life
    I don't think he would have died old even if he lived to be
    one hundred. I will miss him deeply and often. One thing that
    consoles me (and perhaps others) is that I really believe I
    will see him again in the hereafter. His smiling, animated
    face and his great laugh. Another consolation, as Greg said,
    is the great memories of the times we shared together. There
    is a sonnet from Shakespeare that expresses both my current
    feelings (in the first few verses), and the way I am sure I
    will think about Zach in the coming weeks or months (in the
    last verse). There is a very deep sense of loss now, but I
    believe that the memory of him will turn my thoughts into
    something very positive when I think of him in the future. <cite>When
    to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up
    remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I
    sought, And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste: Then
    can I drown an eye, unused to flow, For precious friends hid
    in death's dateless night, And weep afresh love's long since
    cancelled woe, and moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
    Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, And heavily from
    woe to woe tell o'er The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
    Which I new pay as if not paid before. But if the while I
    think on thee, dear friend, All losses are restored and
    sorrows end. </cite>My deepest regrets to his relatives and
    to his family of friends. </p>
    <p>Response #47: <strong>BOTTINI,STEVE</strong> &gt;From my
    humble perspective, Michael was a light that illuminated
    everyone who knew him. Judging by these responses, his light
    will burn forever. We have truly been blessed. </p>
    <p>Response #48: <strong>DIAMOND,JON</strong> I too was
    touched by him. He was the clown of our community and we will
    never forget him. </p>
    <p>Response #49: <strong>HIRZ,LEE </strong>I read a science
    fiction story once about a world in which a method had been
    perfected that offered people immortality by creating matches
    between individuals such that if one had a match, his 'soul'
    would upon death migrate into one one of his living matches.
    The 'dead' person would exist at first in the 'living'
    persons mind, then gradually the personalities would merge
    till the remaining personality was a hybrid of the two. And
    so people found great comfort that something of them would
    live on, if they had a match. But reality is often not so far
    from fiction. It seems that Xak had a lot of matches. Last
    time I saw him he had brought me a Giant Sequoia from San
    Francisco. I think I'll name it Xak. </p>
    <p>Response #50:<strong> WINN,TAMI </strong>I have tried so
    many times to respond to this message but it's so hard to
    find words for what Michael and Keith both meant to me. I
    remember so well the first time I met Michael. I just thought
    he was one of the most fun people I'd ever met and I knew
    we'd be friends. When my husband and I moved to San Francisco
    from Boise, Idaho, he turned a big scary city into a warm and
    loving place for us. He and Keith took us all over and told
    us the good and bad parts of town, and even went apartment
    hunting with us. We lived close to Michael and Keith, and
    went out with them often. They were our friends and
    neighbors. I was going to start work on Fileman with Michael
    in a few weeks, and I could hardly wait. I wanted to much to
    work with him. I've rarely met a person I respected so
    professionally. I know I could have learned so much from him.
    Now we'll just have to stumble through as best we can. We'll
    try our best to live up to his standards of excellance. </p>
    <p>Response #51: <strong>WINN,TAMI </strong>Michael, I'm
    going to miss you. You were a light in my life and I loved
    you. </p>
    <p>Response #52: <strong>SEHON,GEORGIA</strong> Although I
    did not know Michael as well personally as many of you did, I
    did know his work and admired his talent. I too teach Fileman
    classes and will always think of him as I continue to teach
    future classes. My prayers go out to his family and friends.
    His talents will be dearly missed. </p>
    <p>Response #53: <strong>HOLMBERG,JOHN</strong> As has been
    stated so many ways - Gone, but never forgotten. You will be
    greatly missed, Michael. </p>
    <p>Response #54: <strong>MUNNECKE,TOM </strong>I, too want to
    express my sorrow, but want to speak of something gained.
    There would not have been this outpouring of sentiment if we
    had not all felt a sense of gain from Michael's contribution
    to our lives. This gain does not magically stop with his
    passing. He was incredibly energetic, spending little energy
    resisting his passions. People always knew his opinion on a
    subject. He had a stong inner sense of where he was going and
    how to get there, and it was through this inner strength that
    he had such a powerful effect on the community. He had the
    ability to focus intensely on a specific problem, and he was
    intuitively drawn to the most significant problem. If he were
    here now, he would probably show up in his clown outfit and
    say, &quot;Don't be so sentimental. Get on with what you were
    doing.&quot; We can all look to XAK as an inspiration for
    what an individual can do in a community by following their
    inner strengths. This is what should be savored in this time
    of loss. </p>
    <p>Response #55: <strong>BOYDEN,GEORGE</strong> MICHAEL CAME
    TO THE VA FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY DP. I ADVISED THEM OF OUR
    LOSS AND THIER EXPRESSIONS REFLECTED THE SAME LOVE AND HIGH
    REGARD AS SHOWN IN THE ABOVE REPLIES. </p>
    <p>Response #56: <strong>HARVEY,JULIE S</strong> I first met
    Zach in the back seat of a Thunderbird in 1983. His
    electricity scared the hell out of me. Verifying File Manager
    has been the most terrifying part of my job over the years.
    Verifying for Zach was the most exhilarating. The faith he
    placed in me put pressure on me but he was always there for
    reassurance and gave me great opportunities to learn from
    him. I've been blessed in sharing his world. He flattered me
    by letting me in. I will miss our crazy calls, his
    uncontrolled laughter, his ranting and raving about how
    things should be. Thank you Michael for letting me believe
    that I could be what you said I could be. And thank you for
    getting me there. </p>
    <p>Response #57: <strong>SCHALLOCK,MICHAEL</strong> Michael
    always treated us like we were just part of the family. We
    miss him, too, both as friend and colleague. </p>
    <p>Response #58: <strong>KILMADE,MIKE </strong>Oh Michael,
    this is so sad. It hurts so much. My mind says you're gone
    but my soul still wants to dial the phone and hear your
    voice. I know this hurt will ease in time. But right now, I
    mourn. I think of all the things we did together. I think
    mostly of our friendship and our late night calls. Just
    talking. Soon my little Joey is going to ask to call his
    Godfather and I'm going to have to make something up. He
    won't understand. (I don't even understand.) 'For A Dancer' <cite>Keep
    a fire burning in your eye, pay attention to the open sky,
    you never know what will be coming down. I don't remember
    losing track of you, you were always dancing in and out of
    view, I must have thought you'd always be around, always
    keeping things real by playing the clown; no you're nowhere
    to be found. I don't know what happens when people die, can't
    seem to grasp it as hard as I try. It's like a song I can
    hear playing right in my ear that I can't sing, I can't help
    listening. And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round,
    crying as they ease you down, 'cause I know that you'd rather
    we were dancing, dancing our sorrow away no matter what fate
    chooses to play. Just do the steps that you've been shown by
    everyone you've ever known until the dance becomes your very
    own. No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown,
    in the end there is one dance you'll do alone. Don't let the
    uncertainty turn you around. Go on and make a joyful sound.
    Into a dancer you have grown from a seed somebody else has
    thrown. Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own. And
    somewhere between the time you arrive and the time you go,
    may lie a reason you were alive but you'll never know. </cite>(Jackson
    Browne) Goodbye, dear friend. </p>
    <p>Response #59: <strong>GINSBURG,RON</strong> I feel very
    sad reading this message of Michael's untimely and tragic
    death. In the early days before DHCP I remember his kindness
    and patience when trying to show the virtues of Fileman to
    the skeptics. His DHCP package reviews and Fileman classes
    were superb learning experiences done with raucous laughter
    and unabashed enthusiasm. I will always remember Michael's
    many endearing qualities that made him a truly unique,
    delightful, and lovable person. His contributions to DHCP and
    the MUMPS community were outstanding. Good-bye Michael, I'll
    miss you. </p>
    <p>Response #60:<strong> TANOUS,TERRY </strong><cite>'...
    winter came along and you were not around ...' </cite>I first
    met Michael six years ago. A couple of years after meeting
    Michael I lost a close friend, whose absence created a void
    from within. But then there was Michael, a character among
    characters who managed to help fill that void. I remember his
    laughter, impish expressions, and most of all the sparkle in
    his eyes. I knew about living - and losing - and appreciated
    Michael's love for life because of it. Michael exuded life to
    others around him. I always wanted to thank Michael for being
    him, but like my friend, I always thought that there was
    time. With a heavy heart I wish to express my condolences to
    his family and friends. May Michael and Keith find eternal
    happiness. Thank you, Michael. </p>
    <p>Response #61: <strong>ROY,JERRY</strong> Irreplaceable.
    Absolutely irreplaceable, not as a colleague (which he
    probably is) but as a friend. Someone who was there during
    the good times and especially the bad times. He was there
    when you just needed a lift when feeling down. And he was
    there to lend support and courage during the illness of a
    loved one. Michael had a way of accentuating the positive. I
    told him not too long ago that I always felt so much better
    about myself and life after being with him. I'm fortunate
    because I realized he was special long ago, and cherished the
    times we had together. I'll miss him forever. </p>
    <p>Response #62: <strong>RUH,LARRY</strong> I received the
    news of Michael's demise from the Forum Postmaster at church
    this past Sunday. I was shocked and sorrowful that the spirit
    of one so full of humor and life was now removed from us. May
    we all remember his forthrightness and eye for the absurd.
    &quot;The spirit forms an unbroken thread from creation in
    two dimensions. Outward to the limits of imagination and
    inward to the heart of each individual.&quot; </p>
    <p>Response #63:<strong> VONBLANCKENSEE,HANS</strong> What a
    unique, wonderful man! I take some comfort from the belief
    that Michael understood (in an off-handed way) how important
    he was to all of us, and how much so many people loved him. </p>
    <p>Response #64:<strong> MALMROSE,CARY</strong> Michael,
    where are you? We're not done yet. Is this just another one
    of your mascarades? I keep hoping, in the back of my mind, to
    sign-on and see you reply to all of this. I guess your reply
    is in each one of us. Michael...thank you for being fair, for
    rising above the contemptuous ...thank you for sharing ...and
    especially, thank you for caring enough to look beyond and
    help each of us to feel important. ...&quot;until we meet
    again&quot;... </p>
    <p>Response #65: <strong>BADER,ED</strong> Time will heal the
    deep hurt and sorrow I feel, but the memory of the many good
    times, your laugh and wise counsel over the years will live
    with me all of my days. Thank you Xak for these gifts which
    transcends all time. You were the Clown of Clowns!!!!!!!!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>Response #66: <strong>MILLER,CHYLTON</strong> If FORUM can
    in any way be compared to the National Inquirer, then XAK is
    its Elvis. XAK, like Elvis, lives! In each of us... Thanks
    for the memories.</p>
    <p>Response #67:<strong> VAN-HOOSER,DAVID </strong>It is with
    deep sadness that I say good-bye to our good and true friend.
    His passion for living led him over many trails. I rejoice
    that our paths crossed. There will never be a happier clown.
    Thank you for your friendship and caring. May God be with you
    Michael Zachary. </p>
    <p>Response #68: <strong>LEACH,MARSHALL</strong> It's been a
    week now and I still find it hard to find the words to
    express what this wonderful person meant to me. They say that
    over time hurt will heal and things will get back to normal.
    Well I think we've found the exception to the rule in XAK. He
    is truly one person who is irreplaceable and the hurt will be
    felt both personally and professionaly for many years to come
    by all who were fortunate enough to come in contact with him.
    Yes, he will be greatly missed but we are more fortunate than
    those who never knew him because we have the memories. No, I
    won't say good-bye to XAK because he's not really gone. His
    laughter will ring in my ears for many years to come and
    everywhere I turn I'll continue to see his influence. I can
    see XAK now convincing St. Peter to let him automate the
    entry procedures to heaven in this wonderful language called
    MUMPS. You can call MUMPS anything you want but, for the many
    people like myself who wouldn't be where we are now were it
    not for Michael, MUMPS will always be XAK. In my estimation
    no one person has given more of him/herself in promoting both
    the product and the people. You'll always be with us XAK ...
    till we meet again ... </p>
    <p>Response #69: <strong>MCDONALD,GERALD</strong> A comment
    by Michael at MUG N.O.: MUG is a great opportunity for all us
    BS'ers to get together and hear all the BS that's going
    around. You know, I kinda wondered if he was referring to my
    trying to BS my way through a short discussion with him on
    FILEMAN? </p>
    <p>Response #70: <strong>HOYE,MAUREEN</strong> This is so
    hard to write, I've been waiting to hear this was a mistake.
    Working with Michael has been the most difficult,
    frustrating, challenging, rewarding, and fun experience of my
    career. I am grateful for that opportunity, he helped me so
    much. I will miss him every day. There really were times when
    he was on the phone, laughing so hard he had to close his
    door. His laughter penetrated to walls and I wondered how I
    would concentrate. Now the silence is deafening. Michael and
    Keith were part of our extended family. Ski trips, birthday
    parties, races, holidays, exchanging 'prizes', all were
    brighter because they were there. My husband and I are
    grateful for the many, many, wonderful memories. They were
    two bright stars in our lives. We loved them and will miss
    them dearly. Goodbye Michael Distaso, goodbye Keith Orner. </p>
    <p>Response #71:<strong> DOLAN,BOB</strong> What a shock! The
    loss of Michael will be surely felt by all of the IHS, he was
    a personal as well as professional friend. Thanks XAK for all
    you did for the Indian Health Service. Goodbye Michael, Good
    luck in your next life. </p>
    <p>Response #72: <strong>SCHLEHUBER,CAMERON</strong> I've
    never had a message so hard for me to respond to. The emotion
    is almost overwhelming. I remember meeting Michael for the
    first time some years ago (Before DHCP). The exact location I
    don't remember, but I do remember Wally pointing Michael out
    to me. He was standing in a broad lobby, very purposely
    stepping forward, to the side, and back, obviously very deep
    in thought, in a world of his creation. I walked up to him
    and asked how much he was involved with Filemanager ...
    Another time, probably half as many years ago, I quite
    unexpectedly provoked a remarkable outburst (even for
    Michael). I thought the glass might break on the wrought iron
    table as he clambered across it yelling &quot;You know users
    will change it!&quot; Michael would sometimes reminisce that
    it was one of two times that he was furious beyond control,
    but he didn't remember what it was that made him so mad. I
    never reminded him. And there was the moment a couple of
    years ago at a dinner party where as usual some small,
    innocuous items were being projected across the table. The
    conversation had become somewhat stuffy and heavy, and while
    several knotted napkins had been lobbed gently back and
    forth, some of us continued to (try to) ignore the frivolity.
    After a quick motion in my peripheral vision I glanced and
    ducked just as a more vigorously thrown napkin missed me and
    hit David Van Hooser. Michael helped us all be so much more
    human while we were working so hard. I could imagine Michael
    receiving a Nobel Prize, if they gave one, for integrity. He
    could have even taught Richard Feynman a few things ... There
    are those who say Michael was present at the Creation and
    assisted with it. Indeed he was. Perhaps (I hope I'm not
    being sacreligious) our era will be divided by the
    designations BD (Before DHCP), and AD (After Distaso). </p>
    <p>Response #73:<strong> MEIGHAN,MIKE</strong> There will be
    a brief memorial for Xak's Seattle area friends on the 12:15
    PM Winslow ferry on Monday December 11th. We'll meet on the
    passenger deck, forward, on the starboard side. </p>
    <p>Response #74: <strong>HOFFMAN,JOHN</strong> Keith, Xak,
    and most of the staff here engage ourselves in] a constant
    game of competitive quotations. Xak challenged me to find the
    'No Man Is An Island.' poem. Well, it's not a poem. John
    Donne, 1623: <cite>. . . The bell doth toll for him that
    thinks it doth; and though it intermit] again, yet from that
    minute that that occasion wrought upon him, he] is united to
    God. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but
    who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who
    bends not his ear to any bell, which ypon any occasion rings?
    but who can remove it from that bell,which is passing a piece
    of himself out of this world? No man is an island entire of
    it self; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the
    maine; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the
    less, as well as if a promontorie were, as well as if a
    Mannor of thy friends or of thine own were; any mans death
    diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And
    therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It
    tolls for thee. Neither can we call this a begging of misery
    or a borrowing of misery, as though we were not miserable
    enough of our selves, but must fetch in more from the next
    house, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbours. Truly
    it were an excusable covetousnesse it we did; for affliction
    is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. . .. . </cite>.
    </p>
    <p>Response #75: <strong>GIGLIA,ELLEN</strong> I've started
    writing this message countless times. And each time I have
    stopped because the emotions I feel cannot be expressed
    adequately with words. They require tears for the sense of
    loss I feel. Words cannot replace the need to hug and hold
    those who remain - to reaffirm the bond that we feel for each
    other - to comfort the body as well as the mind. There must
    be laughter, and dancing, and a drink (or two) to toast the
    joy Xak and Keith brought to us all. To Michael and Keith,
    Thank you. You made my life so much richer. I'll miss you
    both. Love, Ellen </p>
    <p>Response #76: <strong>ACKERMAN,TOM</strong> This is a
    great LOSS to the MUMPS Community as well as the VA. We will
    miss Michaele's smiling face at the MDC meetings. My deepest
    regrets to his relatives and many Friends. </p>
    <p>Response #77: <strong>AUCHMOODY,RICHARD</strong> I have
    read all the wonderfully eloquent and poetic rememberances of
    Michael. They have made me laugh. They have made me cry.
    There is very little that has been left unsaid. But, this
    past week I have felt like something has been missing. I now
    know what it is. I miss Michael's laughter. I miss his
    energy. I miss his honesty. I miss his integrity. I miss his
    clown suit. I miss his sailor suit. I mis his red sneakers! I
    miss you Michael. God be with you and Keith. </p>
    <p>Response #78: <strong>FORT,WALLY</strong> Good Bye
    Michael, We all will miss you. Love wally </p>
    <p>Response #79: <strong>DIVERS,JACK</strong> On behalf of
    the DEC-16 class in Chicago, even though there are some here
    who did not know you personally; I, as their evaluator and
    spokesperson, dedicate this class and it's performance and
    future progress to your memory. You were special. </p>
    <p>Response #80: <strong>MILLIGAN,LLOYD</strong> I am deeply
    saddened. As others have expressed more eloquently, Michael
    was uniquely brilliant and uniquely human. Our consolation is
    an enduring gratitude for his life and irreplaceable
    contributions. </p>
    <p>Response #81:<strong> JONES,RICK</strong> You just do not
    know what to say. What a GREAT loss! Michael's contributions
    have made DHCP what it is today. His hard work, dedication,
    professionalism, ideaes, honesty, laugther, etc. will always
    be remembered. He has taught me alot! When I here of MUMPS, I
    will remember Michael. When I here of FileMan (DI) I will
    think of DIstaso. You will be missed</p>
    <p>! Response #82: <strong>MCARTHUR,JAMES</strong> All of us
    in the IHS share in the sense of personal loss in the death
    of Michael. He will be missed far beyond the walls of the VA.
    </p>
    <p>Response #83: <strong>SCHLUEDERBERG,SUSAN</strong> I have
    been postponing this reply, first due to shock, then due to
    the inability to capture my feelings in words. Goodbye
    Michael. We all will miss you - the laughter, the honesty,
    the champagne toasts. There has been comfort and joy in
    reading the rememberances of your other friends. It seems to
    me that there is a commitment to keeping the spirit/hope/zest
    of your life alive among us, and that makes me smile. </p>
    <p>Response #84: <strong>LINK,CHARLE</strong>S This is only
    the umteenth time I've started this reply. I've only known
    Michael a few years, and probably not that well. I dare not
    try to imagine how those of you who have known him longer
    must feel, but my heart goes out to you the most. When I'd
    get to go to a meeting, one of the first things I'd want to
    know was if Michael was going to be there. The latest thing
    was going to baseball games and then giving him a rough time
    when his Red Sox lost. (Damnit Michael! You were supposed to
    take me to Fenway!) What Michael couldn't have known was how
    much I learned from him, about people, how he treated others.
    He might be surprised at the attention I paid when he talked.
    Since I can't make it to San Francisco, I hope to meet a lot
    you soon (maybe at MUG) and spend at least one evening to
    regale in Michael tales over beer and Wild Turkey. (I know
    how and why the infamous &quot;Napkin Massacre&quot; got
    started.) </p>
    <p>Response #85: <strong>KUHN,INGEBORG</strong> Michael, It
    was a Joy to know you and to work with you. It will be a Joy
    to remember you. Good-Bye Ingeborg </p>
    <p>Response #86: <strong>MCINTYRE,MICHAEL</strong> Zack, I
    still have some questions about fileman that I wanted to ask
    you... I'll miss you at MDC especially since we're having it
    at your place this time. Thanks. -Mike Mc </p>
    <p>Response #87: <strong>MASHBURN,JAMES </strong>Dear
    Michael, I promised to never yell at you again, and I still
    won't; Dear Keith, goodbye fellow &quot;twin&quot;, we still
    need to spend more time together. </p>
    <p>Response #88: <strong>SALANDER,THOMAS</strong> Each day, I
    sign on and there is more to remind me that Michael is gone.
    I had begun to dread the message &quot;XAK&quot;. Michael was
    insidious; he dug into my life, and my heart, and I never
    knew, until he was gone. Every time, more rememberances, the
    wound re-opened. Oh, Michael. But all these friends...
    Michael, can you see this, all this love? All these lives,
    touched with your smile, your laugh? Oh, your laugh. So many
    still hear your laugh. It shouldn't make me cry. There should
    be comfort, here. Knowing that others also geave. Other
    lives, missing so much. This isn't like you, Michael, leaving
    untied threads. But we tell each other that, yes, I miss him
    too. And we forgive you. We can't help ourselves. We loved
    you. With such a large family, Michael, with so many that
    love you, that hear your laugh, hear your insight, integrity,
    and joy, with all this, Michael, you haven't died. You're
    still here, and you'll be with us for a long, long time. </p>
    <p>Response #89:<strong> FERRY,DONALD</strong> Michael, I
    never knew you that well but was always in awe of your
    abilities. I was even more impressed by your humanity. You
    could come up to a site manager like myself who was feeling
    pretty lost at a MUG meeting and make him feel like he
    belonged there. Of all the gifts a man may have love is the
    greatest and God knows you had that in abundance. To those of
    you who worked with him and to his family please accept my
    sympathy and always remember how much he was respected and
    loved. So long for now XAK. </p>
    <p>Response #90:<strong> KREIS,GREG</strong> I have looked
    over this message from the beginning and a curious thing has
    happened. This message started out so sad and was addressed
    to us. During the responses the tone changed as we remembered
    the wonderful times and how much Michael had been the reason
    for them. Tom Salander said it best when he mentioned how he
    did not know how much Michael had been a part of his life. I
    think all of these responses point this out. Now, the message
    seems to be to Michael ! We are telling him how much we loved
    him and appreciated his company. They are right! He is alive
    and we are talking to him as if he was right next to us. I
    will cherish this message for a long time. I have felt
    isolated during this whole ordeal, except for FORUM which has
    made it possible for me to be with so many friends I know and
    those I did not know I had, but for Michael. What a glorious
    way to come to grips with this tradegy and to have it somehow
    triumph by bursting into a celebration of someone so special.
    Thank you Michael. Even in death you have warmed my heart as
    you did in life. </p>
    <p>Response #91: <strong>ALEXANDER,DAVID</strong> A man who
    had his head so high in the clouds that he knew where we
    should be five years from now. A man who had his feet so
    firmly on the ground that he knew what we had to do today in
    order to reach that goal. A man with so much joy that he
    could guarantee that we would have fun every step along the
    way. Good night, Michael. I hope I will see you again. </p>
    <p>Response #92:<strong> FICEK,MARK</strong> Michael, I
    cherish my memories of you. And now I also have the
    collective memories to cherish--memories of all those who
    knew you and love you. You live on in our hearts, but I guess
    that's mainly for our own consolation. I can almost hear you
    saying, &quot;C'mon, cheer up, you guys!&quot; Until we meet
    again. </p>
    <p>Response #93: <strong>ANDRUS,RUSTY</strong> Michael, thank
    you for enriching my life and constantly challenging me to
    grow professionally and personally, I will miss you, but
    rejoice in knowing we will meet again. Love, Rusty </p>
    <p>Response #94: <strong>STANLEY,MILTON</strong><cite> &quot;
    I burn my candle at both ends, It cannot last the night. But
    oh my foes, and Ahh my friends, It gives a lovely light&quot;</cite>
    The passing of Michael has touched many hearts, as evidenced
    by the noble and moving sentiments expressed here. However,
    although gone, the light from his passing still shines as he
    was part of a movement that continues to walk down a path
    made brighter by his presence. My condolences to the family
    and friends. Milton Stanley </p>
    <p>Response #95: <strong>LALIBERTE,DAVID</strong> I have to
    close the door to my office everytime I read the responses to
    this message. I feel very sad about this tragedy. Michael was
    truly a remarkable person in every way. I will never forget
    the moment when this guy from the back woods of Maine went up
    to him and asked for his autograph because he found Michael
    to be so awesome. Michael said very loudly 'you want my
    autograph?'. He laughed and autographed the Filemanager
    Techinical Manual that I was holding. I will forever treasure
    that moment and the support he gave us here in Togus, Maine
    in the early days of DHCP. I still have his autograph and
    guard that manual with my life. Hope we meet again.</p>
    <p>Response #96:<strong> KUHN,INGEBORG </strong>It was a sad
    and happy occasion when Michael was given the Top VA IRM
    award at the IRM conference a couple o weeks ago. The Award
    was presented by the Assistant Secretary for IRM, Mr. Lewis.
    David Van Hooser accepted the Award for Michael. The award
    was in recognition of Michael's outstanding contributions to
    IRM for the VA. This is a new annual award, Michael was the
    first to receive it. </p>
    <p>Response #97: <strong>KUHN,INGEBORG</strong> I received a
    note from Mrs. Distaso, Michaels mother, it contained the
    following: Thank you for sending me as well as to all my
    family the responses you received over the news of Michaels's
    death. (A copy of this message) Many thanks to all of
    Michael's friends and co-workers for their deep sympathy and
    condolances to his family, as well as the flowers, cards and
    letters. Thank you The Distaso Family P.S. As a last request
    please tell everyone to remember Michael laughter, clowning
    P. </p>
    <p>Response #98: <strong>KUHN,INGEBORG </strong>Sorry - Forum
    zapped me.... P.S. As a last request please tell everyone to
    remember Michael with laughter and clowning. As I know in my
    heart he would like to be remembered that way. (I expect we
    have already begun to do that!)</p>
    <p>Response #99: <strong>READ,CHRISTOPHER</strong> after all
    these weeks I still haven't gotten to read all the responses
    to the end! I've heard the party was wonderful and wish I
    could have been there. I hope someone has that laugh on tape
    . . . </p>
    <p>Response #100: <strong>OPSTAD,BYRON </strong>Time is the
    great healer...as others have said it was difficult to
    respond to Ingeborg's initial message. We in Mpls will always
    remember the long hours working with Micheal ie 2-3 AM,pick
    him up at 6:30AM for a flight. a friend gave me this when I
    lost a brother: &quot;In one sense there is no death the life
    of a soul lasts beyond departure, you will always feel that
    life touching yours, that face speaking to you, that spirit
    looking out of other eyes, talking to you in the familiar
    things he touched, worked with as familiar friends. He lives
    on in your life and in the lives of other who knew him.
    ................. the verse seems so appropriate due to the
    many fond memories so many of us have of Micheal. </p>
    <p>Response #101: <strong>SALING,RICK </strong>Even now I
    can't put together a coherent response to tell you how much I
    miss him. I'm supposed to turn this loss into some kind of
    strength, but no matter how much I grow from this or try to
    live up to his memory my life would be better if he were
    still alive. I will miss him until the day I die. Goodbye,
    Xak. We will always remember you, and we will always wish you
    were here. Love, Rick. </p>
    <p>Response #102: <strong>AUSTERLITZ,CARL</strong> WELL IT'S
    BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. MICHAEL WORKED WITH US AT THE FT.
    MILEY VAMC, SF, WHEN WE WERE BRINGING THE OP PACKAGE ON-LINE,
    THE FIRST SUCH BIG VAMC FOR HIM, AND IT WAS QUITE A
    DIFFERENCE FROM THE INITIAL ACTIVITY AT LIVERMORE VAMC. HE
    WAS A VERY DYNAMIC ADP PERSON, AND IMPRESSED US WITH HIS
    MUMPS KNOW-HOW. HE EVEN TOOK A LITTLE BLUE TABLET FROM ME ONE
    DAY DURING A VERY HEATED DEBATE AS TO WHAT WAS GOING TO
    HAPPEN NEXT, AND WHAT SUPPORT WE WOULD BE GETTING FROM THE
    ISC AND THE LOCAL ADP SITE MANAGER. MY, DID HIS MOOD
    CHANGE...... WE MISSED HIM WHEN HE LEFT TO GO TO BOSTON, AND
    GOT INTO MANY A CONFLICT AS TO WHO WAS THE MORE CAPABLE ISC
    OR FIELD SUPPORT ACTIVITY TO TAKE CARE OF OUR NEEDS. HE
    PREVAILED, AND LITTLE BY LITTLE, B'HAM ISC TOOK OVER AND DID
    A VERY FINE SUPPORT JOB. BY THAT TIME, I WAS ON MY WAY TO
    GEORGIA, AND NEVER REALLY WAS IN CONTACT WITH HIM ANYMORE,
    OTHER THAN MY CONTACTS AT THE SF-ISC. ONE THING THAT WILL
    ALWAYS STICK IN MY MIND ABOUT MICHAEL WAS HIS WAY OF
    APPROACHING THIS ADP-MUMPS BUSINESS. AFTER ONE LONG MEETING,
    HE MISSED THE LAST BUS OUT OF FT. MILEY, AND NEEDED A RIDE
    DOWNTOWN. I OFFERED THIS AND OFF WE WENT. AS WE WERE HEADING
    DOWN UPPER MARKET STREET, WE GOT TO TALKING ABOUT WHY HE WAS
    DOING THIS, AND HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD TAUGHT HIGH SCHOOL
    MATH AND WAS BURNED OUT, AND THE WHOLE FIELD OF COMPUTERS WAS
    A CHALLENGE. HE WENT INTO IT WITH HIS FULL EFFORT, AND THE
    REST IS HISTORY. I MENTIONED THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAD HAD IN
    HIGH SCHOOL WITH MY MATH TEACHER AND THE PROBLEMS THAT A LACK
    OF SUFFICIENT MATH MEANT TO ME, AND THEN WE SAW THE
    TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID, AND THE REALIZATION THAT HAD SHE TAUGHT
    IT TO SHOW THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF GEOMETRY, ETC.,
    INSTEAD OF THE CONTINUAL MEMORIZATION AND REGURGITATION OF
    THEOREMS AND SO FORTH, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER TO
    DEAL WITH.........AND HE SAID THAT IS WHAT BURNED HIM OUT AND
    MUCH, MUCH MORE THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM, WITHOUT HIS BEING
    ABLE TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE WITH HIS STUDENTS. I MISS
    MICHAEL,AS DO THE REST OF YOU, AND COULDN'T BELIEVE FOR SO
    LONG THAT HE WAS GONE. HIS SPIRIT IS WITH US EVERYDAY THAT WE
    WORK WITH THIS SYSTEM.
