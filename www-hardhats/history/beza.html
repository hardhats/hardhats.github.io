fluid in his lungs and renal failure.<br>
<br>
As the photo of Fil shows, he had an infectious smile. Those of us that had the privilege to have worked with him well remember his genuine desire to help others and his wonderful sense of humor. Many on the Hardhats mailing list never met him, but they recognized his helpfulness through his donations of time and information.</p>
              <p align="center">The comments below are from people within the VA and from the Hardhats list. They show the great respect and admiration so many had for Fil.</p>

    <h3>Comments from many who knew Fil in the VA<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (these were read at Fil's funeral)</h3>
    <p>Fil was one of the first VA people I met over 20 years ago. He was a kind, gentle, extremely knowledgeable guy that I could laugh with and ask questions. He asked me to test network Mailman out to Honolulu. It worked. When he visited Honolulu, we worked together until very late at night and he never said a bad word, he was just a huge help to this newbie. </p>
    <p>I am in disbelief! I am truly saddened by his passing. Fil hired me at the SFISC back in 1987, even though I didn&rsquo;t know squat about application support. He was willing to let me learn on the job. Needless to say, my career greatly benefited from his decision. And I learned a lot from him. One of my first lessons was to make sure I had his attention before I started talking. I would often barge into his office, and he would be in the middle of something on the computer, yet I would just launch into whatever issue I was seeking counsel on. After a few moments, he would break away from what he was focusing on, and I would have to repeat everything I said. He was SO into what he was doing, he didn&rsquo;t even hear me. We lost a great man and a great resource.</p>
    <p>This is a great shock. Fil was such a nice man. He had a great sense of humor. First time I met him was 1988. I remember telling him he looked nothing like his voice he chuckled greatly. He was a bright, eager, helpful man. Fil, may you find peace and rest</p>
    <p>I too have known Fil for many years and have worked with him at various times. He was such a high quality person, funny but at the same time gave his all for his fellow employee&rsquo;s but more importantly for the VA. Even thought he is no longer with us, I can close my eyes now and hear his voice, his laughter and see his smile. He never failed to talk with people when he saw them and always made me feel welcome no matter where I would run into him. He was such a gentle spirit and I will never lose those images and fond memories that I have of him. He will be part of the VA forever&hellip;.. I extend my condolences to all his family, loved ones and friends. My life was certainly better for knowing such super person.</p>
    <p>Fil was a class act. He was always willing to happily help. I never knew a problem he couldn&rsquo;t handle. He taught me SO much over the years. I think everyone knows I&rsquo;m not just being kind when I say VA is at a loss without him. He touched so many lives, made so many lives a bit better. He really does leave a legacy around here. I&rsquo;ll never forget him. </p>
    <p>He taught me how to eat with Chopsticks. I&rsquo;m taking my family to Stix tonight, we&rsquo;re going to Celebrate Fil&rsquo;s life. He would want it that way.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ll have so many wonderful memories of Fil. He was an intelligent, witty and very nice person. I&rsquo;ll never forget the time when I had to go down to the computer room shortly before I moved back to Boise, because I&rsquo;d just killed ^DIC in the ISC mail account. I asked Fil whether he kept backups. He said he did, but he hadn&rsquo;t ever had to do a restore. I told him &ldquo;well here&rsquo;s your chance&rdquo;. He was so kind and understanding; even though he did give me some well deserved ribbing for it. I&rsquo;ll also never forget how when we all went out for Dim Sum, we would be jockeying for a position at a table other than where either Fil or George Timson sat, because it was always so expensive at their table. I&rsquo;ll really miss him, he was truly one of the good guys.</p>
    <p>Fil and I used to travel together on a regular basis and he&rsquo;d invariably forget to bring extra socks or a tie. After a few trips where we&rsquo;d swing by a clothing store to pick up socks, I finally packed an extra pair and handed them to him when we got to the hotel as a joke. Several years passed and we each went on to other things and we found ourselves together again at some meeting and the first words out of Fil&rsquo;s mouth were &rdquo;did you bring me any socks?&rdquo; Fil could joke about himself as well as keeping things light for everyone else. Fil combined professionalism with an easy going approach. He never felt the need to show off just how much he knew and a lot of folks learned much from Fil because he was so approachable. As Tami said, Fil was one of the good guys.</p>
    <p>When I got the message yesterday, I told my wife Fil was very ill and she started reciting some Beza stories. Fil and she had only been together a few times many years ago. The fact that she could remember things Fil said and did 10 years ago is a testimony to what an impression he made on people. </p>
    <p>Fil was a very smart, hard-working, patient, understanding, and unassuming man. There are very few in this world with that combination of qualities. His wisdom showed in the things he did and the ways he did them. This world is a better place with people like Fil, and his affects, though sometimes subtle, will be felt by those lucky enough to encounter his ways. I&rsquo;ll probably think of him, peacefully, every time I eat sushi. What tragic news. This is a great loss!!!<br>
      I remember at the old ISC, Fil was my guiding light in understanding VA FileMan. His preface to any question I asked him about VA FileMan was &ldquo;tell me what the Data Dictionary says. If you have any more questions after we discuss the Data Dictionary, we will go over them.&rdquo;<br>
      His sage advice and training was greatly appreciated and I will miss him very much.</p>
    <p>I am truly saddened by this event. I never really knew how Fil felt about me, but I had great admiration for him. I felt he was one of the reasons I was hired at the ISC a while back. I was extremely fortunate to have work for him while at Martinez. I grew into a better employee and person. Gentle comments help me to personally, while down to earth guidance helped me be more professional, patient, and compassionate. He made a difference in my life and the VA. Like many who I have a fond and entertaining relationship, I will genuinely miss Fil.<br>
  My prayers and love to his family and love ones.</p>
    <p>Sad indeed, Fil was a great help to most everyone in IT, he will be sorely missed.</p>
    <p>Oh my God! I hadn't heard. What happened? Fil was truly a great help and inspiration. I'm absolutely shocked to hear this.</p>
    <p>I am so sad... He was wonderful!</p>
    <p>Just heard of Fil Beza's passing. A good friend and one of the VA's best...he will be sorely missed.</p>
    <p>He was a great help.</p>
    <p>I'm so sorry to hear of Fil's passing...he was not only very knowledgeable, but also able to explain and help others. My sincere condolences to his family and co-workers.</p>
    <p>I'm so sorry to hear this. He was a joy to work with. We will surely miss him.</p>
    <p>I don't have the words. This is just so hard to believe. I owe him so much, and regret not having told him so myself. You figure, you'll always have time to thank those who have helped you along the way...</p>
    <p>Celebrate life every day that you can, and always remember to hug the ones you love along the way.</p>
    <p>amen, Bo - may Fil rest in peace...</p>
    <p>Sad indeed.</p>
    <p>Too sad, just worked with him couple weeks ago. God bless him.</p>
    <p>It truly is sad news. I always reserved my most difficult Fileman questions for Fil.<br>
      He would never fail to help. I will truly miss him.</p>
    <p>I knew he was ill, but not that ill. He was such a good friend. I will miss him dearly.</p>
    <p>I didn't know him, but I did know that when I saw his name on an e-mail,<br>
      I would more than likely learn something new by reading it.</p>
    <p>A dark day indeed...I just learned about Fil from this message.<br>
      A dark day for us...but a bright day in Heaven..as he is now<br>
      sharing stories with Mike Distasio and Tom from Albany..<br>
      God Bless you Fil for all your help to all of us. </p>
    <p>Very sad news.</p>
    <p>I only talked to him on the phone, but he was very kind and helpful. He worked here way before me, I think as the first IRM Chief, or all of IRM here, at that time.</p>
    <p>I'm going to miss Fil alot. He helped Visn 22 out immensely whether it was upgrades, conversions, quick questions - he was always responsive and he had a great sense of humor. He remained unflappable in the face of many system problems and could remain calm and think things through while the rest of us fell apart.</p>
    <p>Rest in peace Fil.</p>
    <p>He was always patient and kind to those around him and he had a wonderful calmness that always seemed to be in his midst. His eagerness to share his considerable knowledge was always an inspiration. Yes, he will be greatly missed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>All I can say is that I admired Fil both for the depth of his knowledge and his kindness and willingness to help others. I feel very fortunate to have worked out of the same office.</p>
    <p>A kind and gentle man. One of the best and the brightest.</p>
    <p>To honor my grandmother my banner for mail has been &ldquo;Every time someone dies, it is like a small library burning.&rdquo; When I think of Fil and the loss of such a nice and kind person and the knowledge that he shared with his entire VA family, I&rsquo;d have to say: &ldquo;With the passing of Fil it is like the Library of Congress burning.&rdquo; His kindness and knowledge will be sorely missed by me and his VA friends. God bless you all.</p>
    <p>Hardhats knew Fil as a terrific person who would go the second mile to help anyone. He was one of the pillars in the VistA community and contributed so much to so many.</p>
    <p>I am very sad today and reminded of how I felt when I heard of the passing of Michael Distaso, another great in the community.<br>
    </p>
    <p>It's easy to see the comparison Greg suggests between Fil Beza and his onetime co-worker, Michael. They both loved MUMPS, and stood up for it. They both could grab a task and work on it tirelessly until it was completed. They both found fulfillment in giving help to others. And they both knew how to laugh and have fun every moment along the way.</p>
    <p>Fil would always be ready with an amazingly insightful answer to any technical question I might pose, and then always disclaim, &quot;Remember George, I'm not a programmer!&quot;, with that sly smile of his.</p>
    <p>I knew him since he worked in the Director's Office at Tucson VAMC 22 years ago, and always enjoyed time spent with him. I mourn his passing, and the loss to all us Hardhats.</p>
    <p>I always looked forward reading his hardhat emails and seeing him at our meetings. Fil's wit and smile will be missed!<br>
    </p>
    <p>I am truly shocked and touched by this news. I knew very little about him but every time he stopped by I could feel that peace around him. My prayers are always with him and his loved ones. </p>
    <p>How completely unexpected this is and what a tragedy for all whose lives Fil touched! It seems so unreal to hear such news. As you say, Greg, Fil was ever willing to render help in abundance, and we will all sorely miss him.<br>
    </p>
    <p>What a shock! He had posted quite recently on Hardhats! I have known Fil since the early '80's and have to agree with all of the sentiments expressed by others here. He will be missed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My thoughts and prayers are with Fil and his loved ones.</p>
    <p>I am still stunned. Rest in peace Fil.</p>
    <p>Not only do I feel saddened by the loss of a teammate, but a kinder and gentler person that I have ever met. Fil I will miss you, but I won&rsquo;t forget you.<br>
        <br>
        My prayers to you and your love ones!<br>
        <br>
        This is so sad. But, my memories are warm and stongly anchored in many adventures we had and how hard we laughed.</p>
    <p>I am in disbelief as well. I had only limited contact with Fil but he was very professional and got the problem addressed quickly despite coming in to a situation that had baggage. He will surely be missed.</p>
    <p> It&rsquo;s so sad, and I&rsquo;ll miss him here. He&rsquo;d always tease me about forgetting my ISC password so I could get into the inventory system. <br>
      I remember at our potlucks, it was important to be one of the first ones in line to get some of the lumpia he brought in.</p>

    <h3>Hardhats Comments</h3>
    <p> <strong>H</strong>ardhats knew Fil as a terrific person who would go the second mile to help anyone.&nbsp; He was one of the pillars in the VistA community and contributed so much to so many. I am very sad today and reminded of how I felt when I heard of the passing of Michael Distaso, another great in the community.</p>
    <p><strong>H</strong>ow completely unexpected this is and what a tragedy for all whose lives 
      Fil touched! It seems so unreal to hear such news. As you say, Greg, 
      Fil was ever willing to render help in abundance, and we will all sorely 
    miss him.</p>
    <p><strong>I</strong> must echo Greg &amp; Bhaskar. I always looked forward reading his hardhat 
    emails and seeing him at our meetings. Fil's wit and smile will be missed!</p>
    <p><strong>I </strong>so regret never having met Fil. He seemed like such a nice person and has 
      been so nice and such a great help to me for the short time I have known him. 
      He was planning to try to come to the next meeting and in DC and I was so 
    looking forward to meeting him. </p>
    <p>He is the one who was largely responsible for the installation instructions 
      for VistA on Cache on the Hardhats web site and was working on more 
      instructions for all of us because he could see we needed them from the 
      questions on the Hardhats list. He helped me with things day, nights and 
      weekends. He seemed to be able to pull answers to the thorniest of problems 
  right out of his hat.</p>
    <p>I am greatly saddened by this news.</p>
    <p><strong>W</strong>e both worked in the same office, and I can only say that I completely
      agree with your impression. This news is doubly shocking to me, only
    having heard that he was in the hospital with renal failure.</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>s a relative newcomer to the board, I had never had
      the pleasure of meeting Fil in person. But from the
      helpful emails he sent me, answering my question, I
      found him to be very helpful, knowledgable, and seemed
      an all-around great guy. I had no idea he was in poor
    health.</p>
    <p>All our best wishes go to his family</p>
    <p><strong>I</strong>t's hard to find words expressing the treasure that was mine for having
      known Fil. I was a student during the days when VA offered courses at MUG,
    SCAMC, and later AMIA. </p>
    <p>This group has numerous personalities I cherish, for reasons too numerous to
      extol. His was the quiet, sincere, fountain of insight and generosity of
      knowledge and skills that I shall carry with me as the example to call on
      when I find myself impatient and abrupt. </p>
    <p>The philosophic attitude one gains approaching septuagenarian status does
      nothing to mitigate the sense of loss triggered by his departure. Already, I
      miss him.</p>
    <p><strong>W</strong>hat a shock!  He had posted quite recently on Hardhats!  I have known Fil
      since the early '80's and have to agree with all of the sentiments expressed
    by others here. He will be missed.</p>
