      As a supplement to VPE's extensive Help text, Greg Kreis offers the<a href="http://www.PioneerDataSys.com/hardhats/VPEUSER.pdf"><cite>VPE 
      User's Guide</cite></a> in Adobe Acrobat PDF format. Written for both beginning 
      and experienced VPE users, it is a distillation of Greg's extensive hands-on 
      experience and his long-running involvement in VPE's evolution. (Dave did 
      the work and I talked a lot. &lt;grin&gt;.) 
      <p>This manual is not current with the latest release of VPE.&nbsp; If
      anyone is willing to update the manual, contact me and we can make
      arrangements for your contribution to the cause.</p>

    This is my first attempt at developing a web page. It was developed in <strong>M</strong>
    using VPE's routine editor. It is two routines long. I tried to design the page to be as
    simple as possible so it would be a good beginning example for other programmers who
    haven't yet attempted to export <strong>M</strong> data to a web page. If you are
    interested in learning about using <strong>M</strong> to develop a web page of your own,
    you're welcome to <a href="LINKS/VPEWEB.EXE">download</a> and review these routines. <em><br>

    this page was re-written with FrontPage for display on the Hardhats.Org site. The general
    layout, however, has remained the same though the links have likely changed.)</td>
