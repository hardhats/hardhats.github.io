      <p>Over thirty years ago, the <a href="http://www.va.gov">Department of 
        Veterans Affairs</a> (DVA) set about on an epic journey with the launch 
        of a mammoth effort to automate their 170+ medical centers. They chose 
        the ANSI MUMPS computer language as their foundation and erected a framework 
        to support their applications. Originally called <a href="http://www.virec.research.va.gov/DataSourcesName/VISTA/VistA.htm">DHCP, 
        VISTA</a> is well suited for use outside of the DVA and healthcare, a 
        very well kept secret indeed.</p>
      <p>At its very core you have all the tools and materials you need to build 
        an economical, efficient, scaleable and integrated computer system. If 
        you swing the boom a little wider, you find that VISTA also contains a 
        <a href="vista_overview.html#Application"> staggering number of hospital 
        applications</a> that all share a common set of files for patients, providers, 
        users, etc. Add to this combination low-cost availability under the Freedom 
        Of Information Act (FOIA) and you have a compelling argument for adoption. 
        It sounds too good to be true, except for perhaps one thing. Where will 
        you get support?</p>
    <p><strong>Help is just a click away...<br>
    </strong>The <a href="volunteers.html">volunteers</a> who erected this site believe in
    VISTA and they want you to have the chance to give it fair consideration. To do this, you
    need assistance and who better to advise you than others who have already constructed
    their systems using VISTA. But how will you contact these pioneers?</p>

    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Beginnings</strong></font><br>
        Throughout its <a href="history/HSTmain.html">history</a>, the DVA's <a href="http://www.va.gov/vama.htm">DHCP</a>
(Decentralized Hospital Computer Program), now called VISTA (Veterans
Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture), has kept the
same goal: Increase the quality of healthcare while keeping system
life-cycle costs under control. A critical decision was made with the
adoption of the M computer language as the foundation of DHCP. Not
without controversy, this strategic decision has been proven over the
years to have been a wise one.</p>
    <p><a name="What_is_M"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>What is M?</strong></font><br>
    M is an alternative name for MUMPS, an ANSI computer language, database and operating
    system all rolled into one. Early M implementations were generally closed systems that
    required programmers to build their own tools and application frameworks from scratch.
    Keeping this early environment in mind will help explain the nature of the VISTA
    architecture.</p>
    <p><a name="Foundation_Framework"></a><font face="Arial"><strong>Foundation &amp;
    Framework</strong></font><br>
    Using the flexibility and power of M, the DVA constructed a <a href="vista_overview.html#Infrastructure"> generic, highly portable
    foundation and framework</a> with FileMan and Kernel. The DHCP designers crafted the
    architecture in interlocking layers.</p><ul>
      <li>M Technology - The M language and database.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>FileMan - Database management written in M</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Kernel - Application framework, based on M and FileMan, providing services such as
        menus, device selection, background task scheduling, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Application - End-user software. VISTA supports the development of these applications by
        providing a framework of Kernel, Fileman and M (MUMPS).</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/os_m_fm_krn.gif" alt="System Layers" height="206" width="282"><br>
    </p>
    <p align="left">VISTA is supported by <a href="tools/sac96.html">Standards and Conventions</a>
    that enforce the architecture shown in the above diagram. These standards are worthwhile
    for any MUMPS programmer to study, but they are required reading for adopters of
    VISTA/DHCP.</p><br><p><a name="FOIA_Request"></a><strong><font face="Arial">How do I get the software</font>?</strong><br>
    The DVA's VISTA software and documentation is available under the Freedom Of Information
    Act (FOIA). Here is how to <a href="foia.html">download VistA</a>.</p></td>
