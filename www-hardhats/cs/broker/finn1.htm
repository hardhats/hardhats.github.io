<p><i>The following has been extracted from a message received from Yrjo Jokinen, Director
of Information Technologies of the University of Kuopio in Finland. Dr. Yokinen and his
colleagues are enthusiastic users of <b>V</b><font SIZE="-1">IST</font><b>A</b>. Over the
past years, the VA and the University of Kuopio have successfully collaborated on several
projects.<br>
<br>
</i></p>

<p><b>V</b><font SIZE="-1"><i>IST</i></font><b>A</b> has been implemented all over the
world, but one of the most successful implementations is in Finland. Over 50 % of the
installed hospital information systems in Finland are based on the DVA's FileMan and
Kernel. This is apparently the biggest concentration of FileMan/Kernel users outside of
the United States. The family of Finnish-made applications packages, called 'MUSTI', is by
far the most important hospital information software in use in Finland.<br>
</p>

<p>The University of Kuopio, Computing Centre, introduced the M and FileMan technologies
in Finland in the 1970s and 1980s. Currently the Computing Centre is in charge of
translating and localizing FileMan and Kernel to fit Finnish requirements, and to provide
technical support to the software houses using these products. The Centre receives new
versions through the DVA's FOIA Office, but have also had a low-volume two-way relation
with the VHA development teams by e-mail. Many small corrections and modifications
proposed by the Finns have been later included in the new versions of FileMan, Kernel and
MailMan.<br>
</p>

<p>As with many systems, there has been growing concern about the user interface and the
system architecture of the 'MUSTI' systems becoming obsolete. Therefore, two years ago a
pilot project was established to study the ways of &quot;modernizing&quot; the
FileMan/Kernel based systems in Finland. After a careful study (Karvinen et al., M
Computing no. 1/1996), they decided to base the modernization on the DVA's RPC Broker and
Borland's Delphi. </p>

<p>Hellevi Ruonamaa of the University of Kuopio was provided with the RPC Broker and
FMComponents Preview Kit during the MTA'96 conference. The pilot project has since
embarked on developing the first &quot;modernized&quot; application package, a Clinical
Laboratory Quality Control System, with these tools. The experience so far is extremely
encouraging. The pilot application will be ready for demonstration and beta testing by the
end of January, 1997. </p>

</p>

<p><i>The Finns also have many additional innovative ideas which closely match the
direction the VA is moving with its expanded VISTA architecture. To continue to build upon
this exceptional working partnership, representatives of the CIO and University of Kuopio
will meet to discuss how both parties can work in a collaborative mode to jointly advance
each other's productivity. This meeting will take place in San Francisco in early December
1996.</i> </p>
