each socket address (protocol/IP address/port) is normally permitted. This error
 occurs if an application attempts to <B>bind()</B> a socket to an IP
address/port that has already been used for an existing socket, or a socket that
wasn't closed properly, or one that is still in the process of closing. For
server applications that need to <B>bind()</B> multiple sockets to the same
port number, consider using <B>setsockopt(SO_REUSEADDR)</B>. Client
applications usually need not call <B>bind()</B> at all - <B>connect()</B>
will choose an unused port automatically.

an address or port that is not valid for a remote machine (e.g. port 0).</TD></TR>

sockets are created with an associated &quot;address family&quot; (i.e. AF_INET
for Internet Protocols) and a generic protocol type (i.e. SOCK_STREAM). This
error will be returned if an incorrect protocol is explicitly requested in the
<B>socket()</B> call, or if an address of the wrong family is used for a

Either the application hasn't called <B>WSAStartup()</B>, or

current active task does not own (i.e. trying to share a socket between tasks),

The requested name is valid and was found in the database, but it does not have
the correct associated data being resolved for. The usual example for this is a
hostname -&gt; address translation attempt (using <B>gethostbyname</B>() or
<B>WSAAsyncGetHostByName</B>()) which uses the DNS (Domain Name Server), and an
MX record is returned but no A record - indicating the host itself exists, but
is not directly reachable.
