</h2>

<hr>

<p><font SIZE="3" FACE="ARIAL,HELV"><b>Overview</b></font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">The RPC Broker establishes a common and consistent
foundation for client/server applications being written under the <b>V</b><i><font SIZE="1">IST</font></i><b>A</b> umbrella. The RPC Broker acts as a bridge connecting the
client application front-end on the workstation (e.g., Delphi GUI applications) to the
M-based data and business rules on the server. It serves as the communications medium for
messaging between <b>V</b><i><font SIZE="1">IST</font></i><b>A</b>client/server
applications. Upon receipt, the message is decoded, the requested remote procedure call is
activated, and the results are returned to the calling application. Therefore, the RPC
Broker can be used to help bridge the gap between the traditionally proprietary VA
software and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)/Hybrid Open System Technology (HOST)
products. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">The RPC Broker includes:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">A common communications driver interface that handles
    the device-specific characteristics of the supported communications protocol.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">An interface component separate from the communications
    driver that interprets the message, executes the required code, and eventually returns
    data to the communications driver.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">A common file which all applications use to store the
    information on the queries to which they respond (i.e., REMOTE PROCEDURE file [#8994]).</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font SIZE="3" FACE="ARIAL,HELV"><b>Features</b></font>

<ul>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">32-Bit Environment<br>
    The Broker operates in a 32-bit Windows environment (i.e., client workstations running
    Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT operating systems). It also continues to support 16-bit
    Broker-based applications.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Dynamic Link Library (DLL)<br>
    The Broker provides a set of DLL functions that allow applications written in <i>any</i>
    MS Windows-based development environment (e.g., Borland's Delphi, Microsoft Visual Basic,
    and other COTS/HOST products), to take advantage of all the features offered by the Broker
    component.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Broker Developer Kit (BDK)<br>
    The TRPCBroker Delphi component provides Delphi developers with an easy, object-based
    access to the Broker. When placed on a Delphi form, it allows you to connect to the server
    and reference M data.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Integrated Single Signon<br>
    The Broker supports a <i>single</i> signon point from a client workstation to the server.
    Users need only sign on once when accessing multiple <b>V</b><i><font SIZE="1">IST</font></i><b>A</b>applications
    on the same workstation.</font><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Initial Client/Server Security<br>
    Security with the RPC Broker is a three-part process:</font> <ul>
      <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Users must have a valid access and verify code,</font> <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Users must be a valid users of a client/server
        application, and</font><br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><font SIZE="2" FACE="ARIAL,HELV">Remote procedure calls must be registered and valid for
        the application being executed.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
