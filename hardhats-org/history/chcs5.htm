<H1>V.  USER-INTERACTION INCOMPATIBILITIES CAUSED BY ENHANCEMENTS TO CHCS
FILEMAN</H1>
<H2>A.  INPUT TEMPLATES</H2>
<H3>&quot;;F&quot; and &quot;;N&quot; Multiple Fields in CHCS Input Templates
</H3>
<P>A CHCS Input Template is allowed to include &quot;;F&quot; and &quot;;N&quot;
Specifiers on individual multiple-valued Fields.  A &quot;;F&quot; specifier &quot;Forces&quot;
LAYGO; whatever entry the user makes to the multiple is considered to be &quot;new&quot;,
as though the user had typed it with quotation marks around it.  Contrariwise, a
&quot;;N&quot; specifier means &quot;No&quot; LAYGO is allowed for that
multiple; the user can only choose from whatever Multiple values already exist. 
The Specifier syntax is case-insensitive, so that &quot;;f&quot; and &quot;;n&quot;
are also allowed.  DHCP FileMan Input Templates do not recognize this Specifier,
and therefore do not support this functionality, which could be significant in
the design of a particular application.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Requires conversion.  Any (scrolling-mode) Input
Template ported from a CHCS environment to a DHCP environment needs to be
examined for occurences of the &quot;;F&quot; and &quot;;N&quot; Specifiers. 
Converting such a Template to run in a DHCP environment exactly as it does in
CHCS would probably entail special programming that makes separate ^DIE calls
for each Multiple.</P>
<H3>&quot;Going down twice&quot; into a Multiple Field in CHCS FileMan</H3>
<P>CHCS FileMan fixed a bug which still exists in DHCP FileMan Version 20.
Suppose, within one Input Template, we want a user to descend into a certain
Multiple Field more than once.  For example, if ADMISSION were a Multiple Field
in the PATIENT File, we might want the user to edit first the DISCHANGE DATE
under one ADMISSION multiple, and then edit some &quot;top-level&quot; data
about the PATIENT, and then edit the TYPE OF ADMISSION under a different
ADMISSION multiple.  DHCP FileMan would be confused by such an Input Template
specification, and would &quot;go down twice&quot; to the same lower-level
fields, DISCHARGE DATE and TYPE OF ADMISSION.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Requires conversion.  (Scrolling-mode) Input Templates
built in a CHCS environment could specify such a &quot;double descent&quot; into
a multiple.  They would not be useable in DHCP FileMan because they have a
different structure. Fortunately, this structure makes them easy to identify in
an automated way: they are characterized by at least one non-integer subscript
dependent from the Global node ^DIE(Template,&quot;DR&quot;).</P>
<P>For example, a Template to do the kind of editing described in the previous
paragraph would look something like:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>^DIE(Template,0)              = DOUBLE-DOWN^2940101...</P>
<P>^DIE(Template,&quot;DR&quot;,1,2)       = 401;.02;401;^2.01;</P>
<P>^DIE(Template,&quot;DR&quot;,2,2.95)    = 1;</P>
<P>^DIE(Template,&quot;DR&quot;,2.01,2.95) = .02;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note the &quot;2.01&quot; subscript just above.  Converting such a Template
to run in a DHCP environment exactly as it does in CHCS would probably entail
separating the one Template into two, with a little special programming.</P>
<H2>B.  MISCELLANEOUS USER-INTERACTION DISCREPANCIES CAUSED BY CHCS
ENHANCEMENTS</H2>
<H3>Lookup dialogue at &quot;?&quot; input offers user a better display </H3>
<P>In the general FileMan lookup routine (^DIC), the user can enter a &quot;?&quot;
when asked to select an Entry.  If there is a large number of Entries from which
to select (more than 18 or so), the user is asked something like</P>
<P>DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE LIST? and at this point is allowed to enter an
up-arrow(^) followed by a string of characters.  This means, &quot;show me the
list, starting from this character string&quot;.  In CHCS FileMan, the list of
Entry names then displayed may include that input character string, if it is the
exact name of an Entry.  In DHCP FileMan, though, the display will begin with an
Entry Name that follows the character string.  For example, in DHCP, the
following dialogue could occur:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select FILE NAME: ?</P>
<P>DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE FILE LIST? ^FORM </P>
<P>FUNCTION          (47 Entries)</P>
<P>HOSPITAL          (4 Entries)</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In CHCS FileMan, the user would see, more appropriately,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select FILE NAME: ?</P>
<P>DO YOU WANT THE ENTIRE FILE LIST? ^FORM </P>
<P>FORM              (345 Entries)</P>
<P>FUNCTION          (47 Entries)</P>
<P>HOSPITAL          (4 Entries)</P>
<P>.</P>
<P>.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Portability Effect: Minor.  This is perhaps an almost trivial difference in
system behavior, but one which could require some user re-training if a CHCS
user found himself in a DHCP FileMan &quot;world&quot;.</P>
