<H1>VI.  USER-INTERACTION INCOMPATIBILITIES CAUSED BY ENHANCEMENTS TO DHCP
FILEMAN</H1>
<H2>A.  INPUT TEMPLATES</H2>
<H3>'REQ' Fields in DHCP Input Templates </H3>
<P>A DHCP Input Template is allowed to include &quot;;REQ&quot; Specifiers on
individual Fields.</P>
<P>The purpose of such a Specifier is that, when the user runs the (scrolling)
Input Template, he is &quot;required&quot; to enter data for such Fields that
have empty values, just as though those Fields had been designed as &quot;MANDATORY&quot;
in the Data Dictionary.  CHCS FileMan Input Templates do not recognize this
Specifier, and therefore do not support this functionality, which could be very
significant in the design of a particular application.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: SERIOUS  Any Input Template ported from a DHCP
environment to a CHCS environment needs to be examined for occurences of the &quot;;REQ&quot;
Specifier, since it must be assumed that a developer who has explicitly added
this Specifier must have a reason for doing so. Accomplishing the equivalent
functionality under CHCS FileMan is not as simple as making the Field &quot;Required
in the Database&quot;!  A general workaround  for this incompatibility is not
apparent.</P>
<H3>'DUP' Fields in DHCP Input Templates</H3>
<P>A DHCP Input Template is allowed to include &quot;;DUP&quot; Specifiers on
individual Fields. The purpose of such a Specifier is that, when the user runs
the (scrolling) Input Template, the 'previous answer' to such a 'DUP'-specified
Field will be 'remembered', and can be retrieved by the user just by typing a
space character.</P>
<P>Of course, Pointer-valued Fields in both FileMan systems have always had the
&quot;space-bar&quot; input feature, by virtue of the way the general &quot;^DIC&quot;
lookup program works.  CHCS FileMan, however, does not have the general &quot;;DUP&quot;
feature.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Minor.  A DHCP Application could easily contain an Input
Template that included a &quot;;DUP&quot; specification on one or more of its
Fields. Such a specification would be ignored by CHCS FileMan, and the user of
that system would not (if he knew about the feature) be allowed to retrieve a
'previous answer' just by hitting the space bar.  Of course, the CHCS user might
become more than a little frustrated if the DHCP developer had somehow included
with the Template a user-visible message to the effect that the space-bar could
be used!</P>
<H2>B.  MISCELLANEOUS USER-INTERACTION DISCREPANCIES CAUSED BY DHCP
ENHANCEMENTS</H2>
<H3><A NAME="EXACT">Lookup doesn't generally stop at exact match </A></H3>
<P>This is one of the most recurrently-troubling user-interaction differences
between CHCS and DHCP FileMan.  &quot;Recurrent&quot;, because of course the
FileMan lookup module is used everywhere within the system.  &quot;Troubling&quot;,
because the difference in behavior is so obvious to the user.</P>
<P>If a File, for example, contains two Entries, named &quot;SUSAN&quot; and &quot;SUSANNA&quot;,
and the user makes a &quot;partial&quot; answer:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select Entry: SUSA</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>then, in both systems, he will see the two matching Entry names displayed,
and be asked to choose which one he wants.  If, however, he knows the full,
exact spelling of the Entry he wants, and tries to</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Select Entry: SUSAN</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>VA FileMan will not generally accept the input &quot;SUSAN&quot; as an exact
spelling of one of the Entry names, but will echo back</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1   SUSAN</P>
<P>2   SUSANNA</P>
<P>Choose 1 or 2:</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>CHCS FileMan, by contrast, will straightforwardly assume &quot;SUSAN&quot;
as the selection.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Uncertain.  One wants to call this a &quot;cosmetic&quot;
difference between the two systems (on the user level), but personal experience
indicates that this is a discrepancy in behavior that continues to jar the user
who interacts with both systems.  In Section VIII, below, we will point out a
potentially &quot;Serious&quot; aspect of this discrepancy, from a programming
perspective: some calls to the &quot;^DIC&quot; lookup module may rely on exact
matches being made.</P>
<H3>Aborting output by typing '^'</H3>
<P>When any kind of FileMan report (including a Data Dictionary listing) is
displayed on a video terminal with keyboard, VA FileMan allows the user who
reads the report to type a &quot;^&quot; character at the end of any display
page, thereby aborting the report.  CHCS FileMan (Version 25) only allows this
kind of report-termination to be done through an implementation-specific feature
(i.e., typing CONTROL-C at any moment during the display).</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Minor.  User-training only.</P>
<H3>'CAPTIONED' output can show Computed Fields </H3>
<P>In using the 'Inquire' option, the DHCP user of 'STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT'
is asked whether he wants to see COMPUTED FIELDS in the Display.  At the cost of
always being asked an extra question in this 'easy-to-use' option, the user is
thus given more flexibility.  If, however, the user has no knowledge of the
current File's Data Dictionary setup, the question is merely awkward, because
the naive user doesn't know whether Computed fields exist in the File.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Minor.  User-training only.</P>
<H3>'Uneditable' Fields don't display and pause </H3>
<P>In DHCP scroll-mode editing of a Field that has been designated
'UNEDITABLE', if the Field already has a value for a particular Entry, then the
user sees something different than the CHCS user: In DHCP FileMan, the
uneditable data is simply shown to the user along with a &quot;(No Editing)&quot;
message, and the user does not need to hit 'RETURN' (as in CHCS) in order to
pass the Field.</P>
<P>Portability Effect: Minor.  User-training only.</P>
