<TITLE>Finland: Dr. Yrjo Jokinen of University of Kuopio visit</TITLE></HEAD>

<P><B><I>VISTA</I>/DHCP Activities in Finland</B></P>
<P>During the week of December 2, 1996, Dr. Yrjo Jokinen of University of
Kuopio, Finland, visited the San Francisco IRM Field Office.  On his first
visit, he described the software development work underway for the hospitals in
Finland using much of the <B><I>VISTA</I></B>/DHCP<B> </B>Infrastructure (did
you know they used FileMan before the VA did?).  The issues they face are
virtually the same as we do - how to shift to client/server, what to buy/what to
build, the speed of technology change, and so on.  Dr. Jokinen was provided a
copy of the RPC Broker v1.0 and its associated (preview) developer kit.  In the
spirit of continuing to foster a closer working relationship with these
pioneers, we will ship him the 32-bit version when we have it ready for field
testing on a wider scale than we have today (as intend to do for many of our VA
colleagues as well!).  Dr. Jokinen also offered us a draft paper - Application
Development with Vas FileMan: From Terminals via Client/Server to Web - which
they are planning to present at MTA in May 97.</P>
<P>On Friday, Dr. Jokinen returned to demonstrate some of their prototype
applications that use the RPC Broker.  He had received an overview of work in
progress for <B><I>VISTA</I></B>/DHCP<B> </B>and he was very interested in
CPRS.  We went to the Intranet and gave him a very good overview of the extent
of the functionality and the overall design metaphor, printing out the
information from the Visual Design page for him.  Dr. Jokinen is interested in
maybe funding someone to visit Finland in early May to show things like CPRS to
a meeting of folks who will be planning informatics solutions for their
hospitals.  He will get back to us on that (talk about an incentive to master
CPRS!).</P>
<P>We also agreed, at Dr. Jokinen's request to consider any way the Finns could
do some development that would contribute to <B><I>VISTA</I></B>/DHCP.  For
now, we have asked that they get their feedback about use of the Broker and VA
FileMan Components to us as we are actively working in these areas.</P>
<P>Dr. Jokinen was a wonderful guest.  He had attended a meeting in which there
were lots of presentations about the Web and was amazed by the frenzy to use
this tool.  He sees the value, but is amused by the stampede to use a tool
without much planning on the part of many of the enthusiasts.  Like us, his
colleagues are wondering if they should jump past Client/Server and just do Web
front ends.  And like us, he feels the security is not sufficient enough just
quite yet.</P>
<P>As we showed him the Intranet content, he was very complimentary.  We looked
at VA FileMan, CPRS, the Visual Design Page and the general overall structure. 
He would love to access it from Finland!</P></BODY></HTML>
