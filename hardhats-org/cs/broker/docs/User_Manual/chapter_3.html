Using the RPC Broker Diagnostic Program</A></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">This version of the Broker includes a new
diagnostic tool for the client workstation. This tool can be used to verify and
test the Broker client/server connection and signon process. This program (i.e.,
RPCTEST.EXE) also displays specific information about the client workstation
that can be useful to IRM personnel when trying to determine and/or correct any
problems with or to test the Broker.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">It displays the following information:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">Default workstation information that
includes the Name and IP Address</FONT><BR><BR></LI>
<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">Local connection information that

includes the Server, Port, IP Address, and Operating System Version information</FONT><BR><BR></LI>
<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">A color coded Link State indicator that
shows the status of your connection (i.e., red = no link/connection, yellow =
attempting link/connection, and green = successful link/connection)</FONT></LI></UL>

RPCTEST.EXE), the following application window will be displayed:</FONT></P>

<P><BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">You should verify that the connection from
the client workstation to the server is functioning correctly. For example:</FONT></P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">Try logging on to the server by pressing
the &quot;Log On&quot; button, you will be presented with the signon window. The
Link State indicator will change from red to yellow to green as you progress
through the connection process.</FONT><BR><BR></LI>
<LI><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">Test various connections by changing the
server and port information under the &quot;Remote Connection Info&quot; block.
To verify the connection process is working properly, try logging on to known
servers and ports with Listeners running.</FONT></LI></UL>
<P><BR></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="arial,helv">You can also use this tool to resolve a
server address without having to log on to the server. Type in a server name in
the &quot;Server&quot; box located in the Remote Connection section of the
dialog box and press the enter key. If the server can be found, the IP address
will be displayed in the &quot;IP Addr&quot; box in that same section.</FONT></P>

the Broker, make sure you check the following:</FONT></P>

HOSTS file on the client. (However, there may be a second copy that WIN95 keeps
in the WINDOWS/SYSBCKUP directory). If Windows 95 detects that some of its core
