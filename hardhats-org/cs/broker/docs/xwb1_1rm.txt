 1. Installation Notes:
    -------------------

    During the installation, you must NOT be running the RPC Broker 
    Client Agent or any application that uses the Broker.

    A. Patch #59 (i.e., XU*8.0*59)
       ---------------------------

       Install Patch #59, if you haven't already installed it,
       after you have installed the RPC Broker V. 1.1. The
       documentation on pages 6 and 34 of the Installation Guide
       did not make this clear.
    

    B. Client Agent and Auto Startup
       ----------------------------- 

       During the installation process, you are given the option to
       "Always Start Client Agent?" when you start Windows. Answer
       Yes so the Broker Client Agent (i.e., CLAGENT.EXE) will 
       automatically start up when Windows is started and so that
       single signon, if allowed, will be operational.

       However, if a particular workstation is not always connected
       to the network upon startup (e.g., a laptop), you may wish to
       prevent Client Agent from starting automatically by answering
       No to this prompt. You can always reset it to start
       automatically by re-installing the Broker client software and
       answering Yes to this prompt. Alternatively, you can manually
       start the Client Agent, double click on the Client Agent icon
       in the system tray, and check the "Start Client Agent with
       Windows" checkbox.


    C. MSM Must Disable Auto Signon 
       ----------------------------
       
       Single signon (a.k.a. Auto Signon) is not supported on
       MSM systems.                          ---
       
       All MSM sites must set the DEFAULT AUTO SIGN-ON field in the
       KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) to Disabled.
       
       NOTE: For more information on single signon and setting the
             DEFAULT AUTO SIGN-ON field, please refer to the
             "Integrated Single Signon for Multiple User Sessions"
             topic in chapter 1 in the RPC Broker V. 1.1 Systems
             Manual.

    D. Windows NT 3.51 & the Broker Client Agent
       ----------------------------------------- 

       If you are running Windows NT 3.51, in order to shut down
       the Client Agent, do the following:
    
           1.  If you answered Yes to automatically start the Client
               Agent when you did the installation, you must rerun
               the installation and answer No to this prompt and
               restart Windows.

           2.  If you answered No to automatically start the Client
               Agent when you did the installation, simply restart
               Windows.   


    To date no additional changes have been made to the installation
    instructions. Thus, please follow the instructions in the
    Installation Guide when installing the RPC Broker.
 

 2. General Comments:
    -----------------

    A. Response Time Monitor
       ---------------------

       ****************************************************************
       Please note the following:

       With the release of this version of the RPC Broker, Response
       Time Monitor (RTM) is turned on for the Broker only. The VISN
       CIO Council endorses monitoring the amount of resources consumed
       by client/server applications that use the Broker. The 
       anticipated use of the RPC Broker for client/server applications
       is not expected to impact system performance.

       The data collected will be used to better gauge the performance
       of VISTA Broker-based client/server applications. If the 
       Response Time Global is getting too large, IRM may purge this
       global using the Response Time Monitor utilities.

       In the future, once a baseline has been established, data
       collection will be turned off via a Broker patch.

       For more specific information on Response Time Monitoring and
       the Response Time Global, please refer to the Kernel 
       Toolkit V. 7.3 User Manual.
 
       ****************************************************************


    B. DHCPSERVER
       ----------
       
       When referring to the Broker Listener, the Broker V. 1.1 
       documentation refers to the BROKERSERVER. However, version
       1.0 of the Broker made references to DHCPSERVER. You may want
       to create an ADDITIONAL entry for BROKERSERVER in your HOSTS
       file or DNS. However, DO NOT REMOVE the DHCPSERVER entry
       already present.

       The DHCPSERVER entry is still required for software that uses
       version 1.0 of the Broker.


    C. BrokerExample.EXE
       -----------------
 
       Currently, the Broker demonstration program 
       (i.e., BrokerExample.EXE, which is distributed in source code
       to be compiled by the end-users) can only be run by users with
       the XUPROGMODE security key.
       
       The option XWB Broker Example has no entry for the TYPE field
       in the OPTION file (i.e., entry should be Broker
       [client/server]).  A user that does not have programmer access
       will get an error when trying to connect using the
       BrokerExample.EXE.
       
       This anomaly will be corrected in a future patch to allow all
       users, regardless if they have the programmer access, to
       successfully use this demonstration program.
