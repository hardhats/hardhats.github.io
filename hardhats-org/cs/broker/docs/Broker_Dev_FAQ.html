<LI><A NAME="cwissue2"><B> Q: Can I distribute my applications royalty-free?</B></A>
<P> <B>Dr. Broker: </B>The executables (i.e., EXEs) you develop using Delphi
and the RPC Broker are royalty and license free. </P>
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="cwissue3"><B>Q: Is source code provided for the RPC Broker
client software?</B></A>
<P> <B>Dr. Broker: </B>Source code for the the RPC Broker client is not
distributed for security reasons. </P>
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="cwissue1"><B>Q: What software needs to be running on my
workstation for development?</B></A>
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B>Your workstation must have:</P>
<OL>
<LI>One of the following 32 bit operating systems:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95</LI>
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT Workstation V. 3.51 or later</LI></UL></LI>
<LI>TCP/IP networking. It is recommended that you connect to your development
server through a local area network (LAN) using a network interface card and
TCP/IP protocol.Currently only Winsock compliant TCP/IP protocol is supported on
the LAN or remotely as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or Serial Line Internet
Protocol (SLIP).</LI>
<LI>Borland Delphi V. 2.0 or higher.</LI>
<LI>The Broker Development Kit (BDK), installed in Delphi.</LI></OL> 
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="codeissue2"><B>Q: Once I set the TRPCBroker property &quot;Connected&quot;
to True, is there any way to verify that a true connection has been established,
since setting properties do not have a return value?
</B></A>
<P> <B>Dr. Broker: </B>Use RpcbPropGet to querry the Connected property.  Even
though the application may try to set it to True, it remains False until an
actual connection has been established and the user is authenticated.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="codeissue3"><B>Q: Is there a mechanism to view TRPCBroker
property settings at runtime?</B></A>
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B>Use RpcbPropGet to obtain property values at run time.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="codeissue4"><B>Q: Can multiple connections be established by a
single program (e.g., multiple RpcCreate ())?</B></A>
<P> <B>Dr. Broker: </B>A single program may create as many Broker components
as it needs.  These Broker components may be used to establish multiple
connections to different IP-ports at the same time.  However, only one circuit
is created for each unique IP-port and will be shared by all Broker components
that &quot;point&quot; to it.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI><A NAME="codeissue5"><B> Q:  Is it possible to call an RPC without
passing parameters?</B></A>
<P> <B>Dr. Broker: </B>  Yes.This version of the Broker (i.e., Broker V. 1.1)
no longer requires you to pass one &quot;dummy&quot; parameter with the PType
field of the Mult subproperty set to null.</P> 
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue8"><B>Q: How can I pass more than one array through
the Broker? (It looks as if the Mult field of the Param property only supports
one array.)</B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B>  The Broker uses a function call approach, only one
value or array is returned. The Param property is an array of parameters. Use
one Param element per parameter. If your aim is to pass two arrays to an RPC,
use Param[0] and Param[1], and set their PType fields to list. 
<BR><BR>Examples using the Param property: 
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>RPCBroker1.Param[0].Value := '10/31/95';
RPCBroker1.Param[0].PType := literal;
RPCBroker1.Param[1].Mult['&quot;NAME&quot;'] := 'SMITH, JOHN';
RPCBroker1.Param[1].Mult['&quot;SSN&quot;'] := '123-45-6789';
RPCBroker1.Param[1].PType := list;
</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE><BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue9"><B>Q: When should I set the TRPCBroker Connected
property to True or False? Does the Call method automatically make a connection
if none exists?</B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> The Connected property gives you full control in
connecting and disconnecting from the server. It can also be used to tell if the
TRPCBroker component is currently connected or not. The Broker also
automatically connects when any call method (Call, lstCall, strCall) is
executed. The connection is maintained until the Connected property is set to
False or until the TRPCBroker component is destroyed.
</P>
<P>You should call the Broker's GetServerInfo function before any part of your
code that establishes a connection can execute. GetServerInfo reads this
information from the workstation, providing the appropriate Server and
ListenerPort the TRPCBroker component should connect to. A good place to call
GetServerInfo is your form's OnCreate event. Then, whether connection is
established by setting Connected to True, or by executing a Call method, the
TRPCBroker component knows the appropriate server to connect to.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue10"><B>Q: What is the difference between the Call,
lstCall, and strCall methods?</B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B>  The Broker uses three methods to invoke RPCs on a
server: 
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Call</LI>
<LI>lstCall</LI>
<LI>strCall</LI></OL>
<P>All three methods rely on the Param property for the parameters. There are
two main differences between these methods. The first difference is that the
Call method is more versatile then strCall or lstCall. strCall can only be used
to return one string. lstCall can only return a list of strings. The Call method
can return either. The other difference is where the results of the calls are
placed. 
<BR><BR>The Call method uses the Results property for the return values. The
strCall method works like a function which can be assigned to some string-typed
variable. For example:
<BR><BR></P>
<PRE>     Patient.Name := strCall</PRE>
<P>lstCall puts the results of the call into the passed TStrings-typed
variable:</P><BR><BR>
<PRE>     lstCall(MyListBox.Items)</PRE>
<P>strCall and lstCall do not affect the Results property.
</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue12"><B>Q: If an M error occurs during processing of an
RPC on the server side, is the error trapped? Is my client application notified?</B></A>
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> It is trapped using Kernel. The client is notified of
the error via a popup window.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue14"><B>Q: How do I make an existing M API available
for use by a Broker client application?</B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> An M API has defined input and output
values/parameters that are passed via the standard M invoking methods. An RPC,
however, needs to do the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Pass data to an API</LI>
<LI>Receive values back</LI>
<LI>Accept input from the Broker (i.e., passing data/parameters from the client
application)</LI>
<LI>Pass API output back through the Broker</LI></UL>
<P>Thus, the RPC can be thought of as a wrapper placed around an API for use
with client applications.</P><BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue15"><B>Q: What strategies do you recommend for
returning disparate data (i.e., data that probably was stored in different
arrays on the M side)?</B></A>
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> One strategy may be to label sections of the returning
array as illustrated below:
</P>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>Results[0] := '[[DATA]]'
Results[1] := 'Some data'
Results[2] := 'Some more data'
Results[3] := '[[Errors]]'
Results[4] := 'Error message'</PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>You loop through the array looking for your labels to indicate what data
follows the label.</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue16"><B>Q: What does the Tag property do? Does it
override Tag in the Remote Procedure file's entry?</B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> The Tag property is inherited from Delphi's
TComponent. The Tag property stores an integer value as a scratch value for use
by a component. While the Tag property has no meaning to Delphi, your
application can use this property to store a value for its special needs. 
<BR><BR>It is not related to the Tag field in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file
(#8994).</P>
<BR></LI>
<LI> <A NAME="codeissue17"><B>Q: I'm creating a GUI version of an existing
application that uses the Broker. If I turn my existing roll-and-scroll options
into Broker-type &quot;B&quot;-type options, can my existing roll-and-scroll
users and my new Broker users both run the same options? </B></A> 
<P><B> Dr. Broker: </B> A Broker &quot;B&quot; type option can <I>not</I> be
run from the menu system. You should instead build a new option for the Broker
version of the application.</P>
