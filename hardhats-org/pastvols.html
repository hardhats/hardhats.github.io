        a fully automatic mapper of FM data dictionary to KB_SQL data dictionary, 
        which is in production at 6 VA sites. Also wrote an automatic mapper for 
        IDX, which is in production at one site. Have experience interfacing M

    <td VALIGN="top"><font SIZE="3">I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from 
      Indiana University of Pa. in 1977 with a minor in computer science. After 
      graduation, I started to work for Consolidated Natural Gas Co. in Clarksburg, 
      WV. There, I programmed in Fortran and Cobol using TSO's to log onto an 
      IBM mainframe. In 1983, I started a new career with Valley Mental Health 
      Center in Morgantown, WV where I continued to program in Cobol using a Burroughs 
      1860 system. My main responsibility there was to develop and maintain a 
      3<sup>rd</sup> party billing system. Before leaving Valley MHC, the agency 
      switched to a TI CMHC System. I was responsible for the conversion.</font> 
      <p><font SIZE="3">In 1986, I was hired at West Virginia University for the 
        WVU Library Systems. There, I was in charge of all library accounts and 
        programming for all staff members. Hardware consisted of in-house PC's 
        and IBM and DEC mainframes maintained in another location on the University. 
        Software varied from PC software to WYLBUR, VM/CMS, VAX/VMS, PL/I, dBASE, 
        C, and SPIRES DBMS to name a few. The biggest project and challenge was 
        PAS (Pat's Acquisition System) where I designed a financial accounting 
        system for the Acquisitions Department of the library system. PAS monitored 
        budgeting and bibliographic information for library materials for all 
        departments of WVU. (This also became my thesis work.)</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="3">While working at WVU, I pursued a masters degree in Computer 
        Science. The classes exposed me to many programming languages, including 
        PL/I, C, C++, Ada, SmartTalk, Oracle, and SQL. It took 6 years to get 
        my degree, but in 1994, I finally had my M.S. in computer science.</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="3">In 1991, I was hired by WV CONSULT at WVU and continue 
        to work for them. Our department is small, now only 3 people, and I am 
        currently Acting Director as well as the lead Systems Programmer/Analyst. 
        It is here where I became exposed to MUMPS and fell in love with the language. 
        Our project started out on a Micro VAX using DSM. Since then, we've switched 
        to an NCR 3430 UNIX platform running MSM/UNIX. My duties here are many. 
        I am the System Administrator for the CONSULT Network, which includes 
        administrating the UNIX server and the Cisco Router. I am responsible 
        for installing and maintaining System V, MSM, VA DHCP, NCSA's httpd, and 
        any other public domain software installed on our server. My newest contribution 
        to the project was to Migrate our M databases to the WWW and provide Web 
        access for our end-users. I have been an active member of MTA since 1993.</font>
