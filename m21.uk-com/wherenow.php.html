<p><span class="emph">M21 - where are we now ?</span></p>

<p><img src="images/john.jpg" align="right" alt="John Burwell">
	Six months ago we delivered M21 to an unsuspecting world.  Since then we've had a lot of feedback
	from the M community, moved on considerably, and enjoyed the process.
</p>
<p>
	We know that our success depends totally on keeping in touch with our customers and the rest of
	the M community.  Everyone wants to know how we're moving forward while some fear we might be a
	temporary flash in the  M pan.  Having sent the MTA the article by Keith Snell &quot;Do we need
	another M?&quot; for the last issue, I've composed an update.  I hope this shows that while the
	standard doesn't fly over Buckingham Palace it continues to reign over the Old Telephone Exchange
	in Rugby.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">The Company</span></p>
<p>
	Staff is always a major  issue for a new company and we're pleased with ours.  All our staff come
	from M software houses and they know what it's like to be dependent on a language vendor.  In the
	light of customer demands put upon our staff their skills and understanding of customer
	requirements have increased enormously.
</p>
<p>
	The support infrastructure is in place and allows us to handle queries and problems in a
	systematic way resulting in same day response.  We have surprised many customers and prospects
	with the speed and content of our support and our internal training program augers well for the
	future.
</p>
<p>
	We have become a Vendor Member of the MTA which we see as a commitment to the M community and
	to restoring the M standard.
</p>
<p>
	Our web site is known and attracts considerable attention from all over the world.  The discussion
	group continues to inspire debate and we have had great feedback from it.
</p>
<p>
	The main feedback regarding the company has been our long term viability.  Customers are concerned
	that we might get drawn into other activities to finance ourselves.  M21 Ltd has financial backing
	from various organisations who are committed to its long term viability.  However, we are already
	approaching the situation where we will be self-funding from sales of M21.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">The Product</span></p>
<p>
	M21 is a stable, proven database and the language goes beyond the ANSI standard.
</p>
<p>
	Over and above these 'basics' we offer various additional products for the M developer.  Firstly,
	M21 is used by several major e-commerce sites using a suite of Web programs previously developed
	for the MSM environment.
</p>
<p>
	Programmers can develop in M21 using a GUI Editor developed in Delphi and distributed with M21.
</p>
<p>
	Both the Editor and the Web interface work through sockets which M21 supplies in abundance!
	This technology of course allows for any kind of visual front end.
</p>
<p>
	The API within M21 allows for interfacing M applications with Microsoft Windows software
	allowing the development of GUI client applications using tools such as VB or Delphi.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="company">Knowledge Based Systems</span> in the US have ported their SQL product (including ODBC links) to M21
	and the finished product is exactly the same as their MSM version.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="company">George James Software</span> who produce a variety of tools for M have successfully ported to M21.
</p>
<p>
	In sum, M21 will be very familiar to M programmers working in other M environments.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">Development Plan</span></p>
<p>
	In the light of feedback from customers and prospects we have deviated from our original
	development plan.  Whereas we envisaged releasing the Windows version about 6 months after the
	Linux launch, events have overtaken us.  (Note that M21 runs under Windows using VmWare currently
	without performance degradation or any functional restrictions.).
</p>
<p>
	Requests from customers using the Linux version have been a priority and we have been surprised
	at how many M users are happy with the idea of Linux.  Perhaps it's because they're essentially
	technical and know a good deal when they see one!  Certainly our experience is that Linux is
	more stable, more resilient and faster than NT - and given the cost that's a good choice of
	platform.
</p>
<p>
	We are now back on course with the Windows development and will make an announcement soon.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">Interest in M21</span></p>
<p>
	I mentioned above the large number of visits to our web site and that these have come from
	all over the globe.  Germany and America supply the largest number of visitors but we have sent
	demo versions of M21 to various Russian states, Finland, Brazil, Spain and even South Africa.
</p>
<p>
	M users interested in M21 come from the educational, commercial and healthcare sectors and are
	invariably from an M background.  It would be interesting to see whether we can attract people
	to M who come from other backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
	We have already had a review of M21 written by Erwin Andrulis for the German MUG publication,
	M Borse.  I'm sure it's excellent but until I can find a German speaker we'll just hope !
</p>
<p>
	Keith Snell is booked to speak to the German MUG conference in October on &quot;Restoring the
	Standard&quot; and he will also be presenting an M21 workshop.  This is a great opportunity
	for Keith to meet those M users in Germany who we've been dealing with at a distance.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">Customers</span></p>
<p>
	We now have customers running on M21 using a variety of applications.  These range from shops,
	mail order, e-commerce sites, large fulfilment houses (including the <span class="company">Daily Mirror group</span>),
	scientific and health users.
</p>

<p><span class="emph">The Future</span></p>
<p>
	We have a clear perspective for the future.  We have to be flexible in product development and
	not build a product that goes far beyond what most M users need.  To supply a stable product at
	a reasonable price we have to limit the functionality to what is reasonably required.  For this
	we need to listen to the M base - we serve that base and don't want to get bloated competing
	with other products or companies.
</p>
<p>
	We have understood that many M users are hesitant about switching to M21.  Whereas they welcome
	there being an alternative and having that choice, they rightly want to feel certain that M21
	will be around for the 21st century.
</p>
<p>
	These doubts have disappeared for many and the next six months will confirm this for our growing
	number of devotees.
</p>
<p>We'll be in touch !</p>
