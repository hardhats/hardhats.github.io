<p>
	M is an integrated programming language and database management system used in tens
	of thousands of applications on computers ranging from PCs to IBM Mainframes.
</p>
<p>
	It is the most portable system in the world with implementations on over 200 of
	the most popular hardware platforms.  More importantly, because it is so highly
	efficient, hardware upgrades are avoided by using existing equipment more
	efficiently.
</p>
<p>
	Applications range from small database applications where flexibility of design and
	speed of access are priorities, to the very largest.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">Some examples of large M users are:</span></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Partners Healthcare (Boston, USA) has the largest integrated client/server
			network in the world with 33,000 connected users, over 5,000 simultaneous
			users averaging 3.6 billion database hits per day.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ameritrade, an online brokerage business in the US, has grown 100% this year
			and has recorded 12 billion transactions per day over the web.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The performance of M is truly astonishing.  Intersystems quote the following for
	Cach&eacute;, their implementation of M.
</p>
<p>
	"...with SQL performance then we typically find that Cach&eacute; is between 2 and
	20 times faster than the legacy SQL databases such as Oracle, Informix, Sybase etc.
	The exact performance increase depending on data complexity, join complexity etc."
</p>
<p>
	Again, KLAS Enterprises published a report in January 2002 comparing Cach&eacute;
	with Oracle, and concluded that Cach&eacute; outperformed Oracle by more than 2:1
	in hardware required and 2.5:1 in Database Accesses required.
</p>
<p>
	<i>PRIAM business software</i>, based on the M21 implementation of M, records
	performance improvements of 2 to 20 times the performance of other databases.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">So, What is M Technology ?</span></p>
<p>
	M technology is a programming language, database management system and 'sub-operating'
	system i.e. tasks are controlled by M within the limits of say NT or UNIX.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">The main features of M are:</span></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>A comprehensive procedural language</li>
		<li>Support for object-style event-driven processing</li>
		<li>In integrated hierarchical data management facility</li>
		<li>Bullet-proof database security and transaction processing</li>
		<li>A multi-user, multi-tasking operating environment</li>
		<li>Integrated interprocess communication</li>
		<li>Support for distributed data and distributed processing</li>
		<li>High-performance client-server networking capabilities</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><span class="emph">Also integrated in M technology are:</span></p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Relational data manipulation tools</li>
		<li>Industry standard SQL</li>
		<li>SQL based connectivity</li>
		<li>Interfaces to windowing managers</li>
		<li>ANSI X3.64 standard support for character devices</li>
		<li>ANSI GKS standard support for graphic devices</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><span class="emph">M is Portable</span></p>
<p>
	The fact that M is so portable ensues from it being an ANSI standard language and
	database. This means that anybody can develop M in accordance with the standard and
	so there are now many implementations of M that can be transferred from machine to
	machine, operating system to operating system in minutes rather than weeks.
</p>
<p>
	Nearly a dozen vendors implement the M ANSI standard language on more than 200
	platforms from the smallest to the largest and under virtually every known operating
	system around the world. Various M tools available through independent vendors provide
	data dictionaries and other management functions.
</p>
<p>
	Originally developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology MUMPS as it was then
	named was only the third language (after COBOL and FORTRAN), and the first database
	to be given the ANSI standard.
</p>
<p>
	The identical standard has been adopted by ISO, BSI and FIPS. A worldwide M Development
	Committee evaluates enhancement requests and recommends improvements to the standard.
</p>
<p>
	M Technology supports new developments in computing technology - distributed
	databases, Windows and GUI's, SQL, XML, Web servers and client-server architecture
	- while the standard ensures backward compatibility.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">M is Scalable</span></p>
<p>
	Companies such as Ameritrade and Partners Healthcare System Inc. cited earlier show
	the scalability of M.  How is this possible?
</p>
<p>
	M has evolved from the mini and mainframe computer world where enormous numbers
	of users accessed gigantic databases.  M just doesn't compare to the type of
	database systems that have evolved in the PC era, but the beauty of it is that
	this super-performing database management system is easily ported to PCs thus
	gaining the benefit of an extremely inexpensive platform to run on.  Obviously
	the cost/benefits of an M system outweigh any other.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">M provides Performance</span></p>
<p>
	An idea of the performance gain of M over other technologies is given in the
	examples given previously.
</p>
<p>
	The Department of Justice in Switzerland handles some 1.5 million transactions a
	day arising from 1,400 workstations in 43 locations.  Switching from Sybase to
	Cach&eacute; improved their performance 20 times over.
</p>
<p>
	Studies show that M can, for the same processing with the same response time, cut
	processing power requirements by more than a factor of four when compared to
	relational database management systems and also reduce disk usage dramatically.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">Cost Effective / Flexible Programming</span></p>
<p>
	Programming under M is much faster than with conventional languages. A typical M
	program requires less than 8% of the number of statements of a comparable COBOL
	program.
</p>
<p>
	M combines an application programming language, a job control language, a linkage
	editor, a database management system and a data communications monitor.  All these
	combine to produce a comprehensive yet flexible development and production
	environment.
</p>
<p>
	One major reason for the performance obtained from M and its ease of programming
	lies in having a language with an integrated database - there is no separate process
	of calling/linking to another piece of software or language complexities.
</p>
<p><span class="emph">World-wide Support for M</span></p>
<p>
	M is supported by M Technology Associations located across the United States,
	UK, Europe (including Eastern Europe), the Pacific Rim and South America.
	These groups are vendor-independent with members from hardware and software
	vendors, academic institutions and end-users. There are also many independent local
	MUMPS User Groups in the United States.

<p><span class="emph">The Future</span></p>
<p>
	Computing's next generation, a generation of interoperability.
</p>
<p>
	Having read the detail above, and being new to M, you must agree that M is
	computing's best kept secret.  This arose because M is so good - the ANSI standard
	meant that there was a world-wide community committed to M but not being commercially
	driven had no 'marketing department'.  Moreover M was traditionally used by
	developers who didn't broadcast the product that gave them a competitive advanatage
	over their rivals.
</p>
<p>
	Quietly, M has grown into a strong and multifaceted contender in the information
	technology marketplace. As it grew, M generated a loyal following of both programmers
	and users. According to a recent market survey by Gartner Group, Inc., this
	loyalty is attributed to M's excellent reliability, database capabilities,
	productivity, and system availability and expandability. M's speed picked up until
	it rated as one of the best &quot;bang-for-the-buck&quot; transaction processors
	around. It unfolded a binding to the popular data interface SQL and it gained an
	open system interconnect to put it a class ahead of other open systems today.
	Another Gartner Group report forecast that M would grow at 4 times the rate of
	other technologies and we are certain that the commercial orientation of companies
	now pushing the technology forward will prove this.
