	<img src="images/keith.jpg" align="right" alt="Keith Snell" width="100">
	After graduating Keith spent 15 years developing application software for the
	Health service. Various flavours of M were employed under different operating
	systems.
</p>
<p>
	In 1989 Keith joined Micronetics, a worldwide company developing and
	distribution their implementation of M. Initially the Technical Support
	Manager, he became Support & Development Director.
</p>
<p>
	In this role he was responsible for the design and management of the
	development projects. The main products developed were the Micronetics
	implementation of M, MSM-SQL which maps the hierarchical M to a relational
	form, MSM-API which allows access to M data from external tools such as Visual
	Basic, Delphi etc, MSM-PDQweb which allows Wet browser clients to access M
	data and applications.
</p>
<p>
	MSM-Workstation, a graphical client product incorporating a Visual Basic like
	tool and using M as its programming language.
</p>
<p>
	During this period Keith travelled world-wide representing Micronetics but
	also the wider M community. He was active on the various M development
	committees and was Chairman of the European MUMPS programming language
	development committee, and Chairman of task groups of the MDC involved with
	the development of ANSI and ISO standards for graphical user interface, event
	processing and structured system variable co-ordination.
</p>
<p>
	In 1998 when Micronetics were sold Keith went on to develop an implementation of M.
	For nearly three years he led a team on this project and this formed the basis of 
	the current M21 product.
</p>
<p>
	Keith decided that to effectively market M21 and still use all his energies
	to further develop and support the product he needed a partnership.  The ideal
	partner would be an M software house with proven development skills, marketing
	ability and good business practice. This he found in PRIAM, a company headed
	by Andrew Kypri, an acquaintance of some 15 years.

</p>
<p><img src="images/andrew.gif" align=right alt="Andrew Kypri" width=100>Andrew Kypri learnt his M at Cap Gemini (n&eacute;e Hoskyns) as a graduate trainee in 1976.  He spent several years developing M applications before moving to Plessey where he was responsible for supporting Intersystems MUMPS in Europe.</p>
<p>Andrew then decided to build his own product, PRIAM, an integrated suite of programs to handle Sales, Stock Control, Accounts, Database and Marketing.  The product was extremely successful and bought by 150 companies including major names such as Dixons, Harrods, Spurs Mail Order, Waterford Crystal, Car Phone Warehouse, Ocean Home Shopping, Games Workshop, Readers Union and several government departments.</p>
<p>With a profitable company behind him, an efficient administration and nearly 20 technical staff, Andrew felt he could be the ideal partner to Keith.  For PRIAM it made sense to have an alternative M option that could be customised and have predicted costs.</p>
<p>Keith and Andrew have formed M21 Ltd, a company based in Rugby, the heart of the UK.  Support and administration are from their 3 storey building which is now a new world-centre for M.</p>
